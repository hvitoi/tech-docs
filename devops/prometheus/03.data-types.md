# Data types

- Prometheus' is an `expression language`

## Expressions

- The expressions can be evaluated to
  - **Instant vector**
  - **Range vector**
  - **Scalar**
  - **String**

## Literals

- **String literal**

  - Defined with quotes, double quotes or backticks

  ```shell
  "this is a string"
  'these are unescaped: \n \\ \t'
  `these are not unescaped: \n ' " \t`
  ```

- **Float literals**

  - Literal integer or floating-point numbers

  ```shell
  23
  -2.43
  3.4e-9
  0x8f
  -Inf
  NaN
  ```

## Time Series Selectors

- **Instant Vector Selectors**

  - Pick a selection from a a time series
  - Uses the metric name as a function
  - `Label matching operators`
    - `=`: Select labels that are exactly equal to the provided string.
    - `!=`: Select labels that are not equal to the provided string.
    - `=~`: Select labels that regex-match the provided string. env=~"foo" is treated as env=~"^foo$".
    - `!~`: Select labels that do not regex-match the provided string.

  ```shell
  # all the time series
  http_requests_total

  # filter the time series
  http_requests_total{job="prometheus",group="canary"}

  # filter with regex
  http_requests_total{environment=~"staging|testing|development",method!="GET"}
  http_requests_total{status!~"4.."}

  # the time series to be used can be picked by a regex
  {__name__=~"http_requests_total.*"}
  ```

- **Range Vector Selector**

  - Like instant vector, but it also select a range of samples
  - Specify how far back in time the values should be fetched for each resulting range

  ```shell
  http_requests_total{job="prometheus"}[5m]
  ```

- **Time Duration**

  - Specified by a number, following by a unit

  ```shell
  ms # milliseconds
  s # seconds
  m # minutes
  h # hours
  d # days - assuming a day has always 24h
  w # weeks - assuming a week has always 7d
  y # years - assuming a year has always 365d

  # concatenation
  1h30m
  ```

- **Offset Modifier**

  - Changes the time offset for an instant

  ```shell
  # request with the instant time past 1 week
  http_requests_total{method="GET"} offset 1w
  rate(http_requests_total[5m] offset 1w)
  ```

- **@ Modifier**

  - Specify the instant time

  ```shell
  http_requests_total @ 1609746000
  sum(http_requests_total{method="GET"} @ 1609746000)

  # offset after @
  http_requests_total @ 1609746000 offset 5m
  # offset before @
  http_requests_total offset 5m @ 1609746000
  ```
