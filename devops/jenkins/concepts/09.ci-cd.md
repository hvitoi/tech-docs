# CI/CD

- `CI/CD` is a strategy that allows you to automate the code deployment, reducing errors and manual efforts
- The `pipeline` is the entire workflow that is executed when going through the CI/CD process
- Your code must always be `versioned`!

1. `Continuos Integration`
   - Merge to mainline frequently (Trunk-based, for example)
   - Avoid merge conflicts by constantly merging
   - Build, package and test automatically (automated pipelines)
   - No additional manual testing is necessary (limited trust in automation)
1. `Continuous Delivery`
   - Fully automated process until production releases (except the action to promote to production)
   - It's an extension of the continuous integration
   - Deploy to Testing Environment
   - Acceptance Testing
1. `Continuous Deployment`
   - Same as continuous delivery, but in this case every successful build goes to production
   - No need to promote anything to production. Everything goes to production

## Jenkinsfile

- Jenkins file is `pipeline as code`

- **Pipeline Syntax**
  - `Scripted Pipeline`
    - Write the whole jenkins configuration with Groovy engine
    - Advanced scripting capabilities and high flexibility
  - `Declarative Pipeline`
    - Easier to get started, but not that powerful
    - Predefined structure

## Steps

- **Test**

  - Build the code with the test script
  - E.g., `mvn test`

- **Test Reports**

  - Test reports can be displayed and shown
  - This is configured as a `post-build` action
  - E.g., test reports under `target/surefire-reports/*.xml`

- **Compile**

  - Jenkins will download the `source code`
  - If there are changes in the code, it will be builded (compiled)
  - Building tools include maven, npm, etc
  - E.g., `-B -DskipTests clean package`. The `mvn` command must be omitted
  - The compile uses the code from the current workspace
  - The resulting `.jar` is saved on the target folder

- **Archive Artifact**

  - `Artifact` is the result of the build
  - Jenkins can archive this artifact to an `artifact registry`
  - `target/*.jar`
  - By default, artifacts are archived in the own workspace
  - Ideally it must be pushed at a separate artifact hub

- **Deploy**

  - After compiling and testing the code, the code must be deployed
  - For that, add a new build step to deploy the code
  - `Jars` can be deployed via shell script `java -jar $WORKSPACE/target/my-app-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`
