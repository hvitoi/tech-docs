# Keptn

- Automate the `multi-stage` continuous delivery and operations
- Keptn orchestrates other tools by using a `event-driven` approach
- Therefore the tools can be easily replaced while keeping the workflow
- Allows `reusable pipelines` defined by a high-level workflow
- Keptn is based on `GitOps` principles

## High-level workflow

- Define the `stages` (dev, staging, prod, etc)
- Define the `deployment strategy` for each stage (direct, canary, blue-green)
- Define the `evaluation` between the stages (performed by lighthouse)

## Events

- Keptn uses `events` to communicate with various tools to send them tasks to be executed (e.g., build by jenkins, deploy by helm)
- For that, `keptn services` are necessary to integrate with each desired tool. Translate keptn events into tool specific API calls
