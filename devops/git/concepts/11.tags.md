# Tags

- Tags is a `static text pointer` to specific commit
- Tags are used to add `release versions` to the project

## CI/CD and Staging/production environments

- Software is developed according to `CI/CD` principles
- Continuous integration / Continuous delivery (or deployment)
- The division of `staging` and `production` environment are part of CI/CD approach
- `Tests` are set up for every merge

- `Staging` (release branch)

  - Primary for testing
  - Usually for internal use
  - Merging is performed frequently
  - Different feature branches are merged into `release branch`
  - Multiple people may have merge rights

- `Production` (master branch)

  - For stable production service
  - For customers
  - Merging happens each 2 weeks or 1 month
  - Usually only release branch is merged into `master branch`. Exception is for a `hotfix`
  - Only few people have merge rights

## Semantic Versioning

- Common approach of numbering software versions.
- `v5.1.3` -> Major: 5, Minor: 1, Patch: 3

  - `Major`: New feature incompatible with previous versions
  - `Minor`: Small feature that doesn't break anything in previous version
  - `Patch`: Small bug fix

- **Pre-release version**
  - `v5.1.3-1.3`: release version: 5.1.3, pre-release version: 1.3
  - `Release candidate (rc)`: It's a preview of the official version (which is launched afterwards). E.g. 2.0.0-rc.2
  - `Beta versions`: beta feature

## Annotated vs. Lightweight

- `Lightweight`
  - It's stored at `.git/refs/tags` (simply a pointer to the commit)

```shell
git tag v1.0.0
```

- `Annotated`
  - It's stored at `.git/refs/tags`
  - It's also an `object`! It's stored at `.git/objects`. It has its own SHA1 hash
  - Stores tag message, author & date
  - It's recommended to create only annotated tags
  - Tag names are `unique`

```shell
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "New tag"
```

## Draft new release

- Allows to `create a new version` from a specific commit in Github
