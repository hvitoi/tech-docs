# Certificates

- Certificate is a "box" with various elements, including the public keys of the owner (a server)
- **Contents**
  1. `Owner info`
  1. `Issuer info` (CA or ICA)
  1. `Public key`: Owner public key (lock)
  1. `Signature`: a hash encrypted with the issuer's private key
- **Self-signed certificates**: certificate signed by the owner's private key and not the issuer

## Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)

- A set of different protocols, algorithms, entities, certificates, etc
- Allow `communication based on certificates`
- Every entity has its own public key (in every certificate)

1. `Certification authority` (CA): Sign certificate and delegate to other authorities (intermediate CAs)
1. `Intermediate CA` (ICA): Sign certificates

- File extensions
  - Certificates (public keys): \*.crt, \*.pem
  - Private keys: \*.key, \*-key.pem

## Chain of trust

- Based on certificates we can build `chains of trust`
- Verify the chain of trust <https://www.geocerts.com/ssl-checker>

### Certificate Authority

- `Certificate Authority`: well known organizations that can verificate and sign your certificate

  - Symantec
  - Digicert
  - GlobalSign
  - Comodo
  - etc ...

- The Signature is the _data_ that has been _hashed_ and then _encrypted_

- **Root CA**

  - Root CA are signed by themselves! No entity comes before them. The owner info and issuer info are the same
  - How web browsers trust root CA? Because the certificates of the CAs (containing their public keys) are installed in the operating system!
  - Root CAs are stored in `/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt` (only root CAs, not intermediate CAs)

  ```sh
  awk -v cmd='openssl x509 -noout -subject' '
      /BEGIN/{close(cmd)};{print | cmd}' < /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
  ```

### Certificate Sign Request

- The entity below sends a `Certificate Sign Request` (CSR) to the entity above
- The entity above take the request and signs the certificate
- The certificate is signed only where the private key is located

### Domain scopes

- `Single domain`: www.instagram.com
- `Wildcard domains`: \*.google.com
- `Multi domain`: .facebook.com + .fb.com + \*.messenger.com
