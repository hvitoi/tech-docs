# Symmetric encryption

- The same key encrypts and decrypts the data
- It's also known as `secret-key encryption`
- The encryption key is generated directly from the password
- It is not possible to change the password/key of already encrypted content. In this case the data has to be decrypted and encrypted with a different password

## Algorithms

- **AES**
  - Advanced Encryption System
  - `AES256`
- **CHACHA**
