# Hash

- Take any-length input and convert it to a fixed length hash output (128bit, 160bit, etc)
- Hash function always generate `same hash` for `same input`
- The hash function is ONE WAY
- Different input generate completely different hashes
- It's a `one-way function`. You cannot take the input value from the hash
- The input can be anything from a short string to a gigabyte file
- The hash verifies if the data was not changed! (Integrity)
- Keys in hashing are optional

## Hashing algorithms

- **MD5**

  - Output is 128bit (each hexadecimal number is 4 bits)
  - `md5sum file.txt`
  - 930db08d7fb48a7e8a524e736f7acae9 file.txt

- **SHA**

  - `SHA1` (160bit - 40 hex)
  - `SHA256` (256bit)
  - `SHA384` (384bit)
  - `SHA512` (512bit)

  - `shasum file.txt` (SHA-1) - 160bit
  - `shasum -a 256 file.txt` (SHA-256)
  - `shasum -a 512 file.txt` (SHA-512)

- **HMAC**
  - Hash with a key: Additional level of security

### SHA1

```shell
# Generate SHA1 hash
echo "Hello" | shasum
```

- Number of different hashes from `SHA1` hash function
  - 2^160 = 16^40 = 1.461501637Ã—10^48
- Chance of producing same exact hash for different files in `SHA1` (`Dice theory`)
  - Probability of each SHA1 hash: 1/(2^160)
  - Probability of same exact hash: (1/(2^160))\*(1/\_(2^160)) = 1/(2^320)
- Chance of producing any exact hash for different files in `SHA1` (`Hash collision probability`)
  - Probability of same any hash: for 2 files: 2.84\*10^49
  - The probability increases with more files. E.g., 3 files -> 2.05\*10^48
