# Vulnerabilities

## Kinds

- **Database Injection**
  - Use an ORM to prevent
- **Broken Authentication**
  - ...
- **Cross Site Scripting (XSS)**
  - Run JS code on a different user's browser
  - Save a script in a web application database
  - Prevented using server-side validation
- **Credentials Leakage**
  - Secret keys exposed
  - Revoke it to fix the problem
  - Principle of least privilege to prevent big attacks

## Peneration Testing

- Test exploit vulnerabilities

- **Burp Suite**: Man in the middle that intercepts every request

- `White hat`: you have permission
- `Grey hat`: you don't have permission
- `Black hat`: sell the data on the dark web

## CIA Triad

- `Confidentiality`: user authentication
- `Integrity`: data is correct (not corrupted)
- `Availability`: data is accessible at any time
