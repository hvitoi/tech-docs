# Stack

- **LIFO**: Last In, First Out
- Ideally built on top of `Linked Lists`
  - Preferred since it has dynamic memory allocation and sequential read or traversal is not needed

## Operations

- `Push`: add a new element to the top
- `Pop`: remove and return the element from the top
- `Peek`: return the element from the top, but do not remove it
