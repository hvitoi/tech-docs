# Combination

- The `number of possibilities` to form an `unordered subgroup`
- Similar to arrangements, but unordered
- Also known as
  - **k-combination of n**
  - **n choose k**

## Formula

- $n$: available number of elements
- $k$: total elements in the subgroup

$$\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!*k!}$$
$$\binom{n}{k} = \frac{A_{n,k}}{k!}$$

## Other symbols

$$\binom{n}{k} = C(n,k) = _{n}C_{k}$$

## Example

- You have a set `{1, 2, 3, 4}` ($n = 4$) and you need to find all possible unordered subgroups of size 2 ($k = 2$), you would have the following subsets:
- 6 possibilities!

```txt
{1, 2}
{1, 3}
{1, 4}

{2, 3}
{2, 4}

{3, 4}
```
