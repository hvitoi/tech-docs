# Traversal

- A way to loop thorough all the elements in a given data structure
- `Example`: in a Linked List, the traversal stops when the next element points to null
- Traversals are usually implemented with a `while`/`for` and a defined `stop rule` according to each data structure

## Iteration

- A special kind of traversal that is done over a `linear data structure` (e.g., arrays)
- Sometimes term is also used interchangeably
