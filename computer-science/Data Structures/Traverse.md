# Traverse

- **Travese**: loop thorough all the elements in a given data structure (just because)

- `Example`: in a Linked List, the traversal stops when the next element points to null
- Traversals are usually implemented with a `while`/`for` and a defined `stop rule` according to each data structure

## Search

- **Search** is a kind of traversal stops as soon as the target item is found

### Linear Search

- Search over a `linear data structure`
  - e.g., array
- It's also called **iteration**
- Runtime complexity: $O(n)$

### Binary Search

- Search in a ordered data structure, in which at each loop half of the items can discarded
  - E.g., sorted array, binary search tree
