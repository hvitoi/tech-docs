# Data Structure

- <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_data_structures>
- <https://www.bigocheatsheet.com/>

## Operations

- `Access` (Lookup): get an element in the structure by its identifier
- `Search`: find the location of an element in the structure
- `Insertion`: add a new element to the structure
- `Deletion`: delete an existing element from the structure

- `Traverse`: cycle over each element in the structure
- `Sorting`: organize the data in the structure in some way

## Language Support

- **Python**
  - `Array`: built-in
  - `Dynamic Array`: list
  - `Linked List`: N/A
  - `Stack`: list as a stack
  - `Queue`: Queue, deque
  - `Priority Queue`: PriorityQueue, heapq
  - `Deque`: deque
  - `Associative Array`: dict
  - `Set`: set, frozenset
  - `Graph`: N/A

## Traversal

- A way to loop thorough all the elements in a given data structure
- `Example`: in a Linked List, the traversal stops when the next element points to null
- Traversals are usually implemented with a `while`/`for` and a defined `stop rule` according to each data structure

- **Iteration**
  - A special kind of traversal that is done over a `linear data structure` (e.g., arrays)
  - Sometimes term is also used interchangeably
