# Tree

- `Parent-Child` data structure
- A filesystem directory structure is a tree starting from `/` (root node)
  - Where a folder is the parent and the files are the children

## Elements of a tree

- **Root**: node with no parent (there is only one in the tree)
- **Parent**: upstream node of a child node
- **Child**: downstream node of a parent node
- **Leaf**: nodes with no children
- **Sibling**: nodes in the same level in the tree
