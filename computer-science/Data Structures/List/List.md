# List

- Also known as **List**
- Stores items `contiguously in the memory`
  - The `physical order` (memory) is the same as the `logical order` (viewed by the user)
- Each item has an `index` which is sequential (starting from 0)
- Lists have an `order`
  - Each element is `preceded` and `succeeded` by another element
  - Except the first one (no precessor) and the last one (no successor)
