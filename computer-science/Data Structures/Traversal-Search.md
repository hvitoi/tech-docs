# Traversal/Search

- **Search**: loop thorough the elements in a given data structure to find a specific item
- **Travese**: loop thorough all the elements in a given data structure (just because)

- `Example`: in a Linked List, the traversal stops when the next element points to null
- Traversals are usually implemented with a `while`/`for` and a defined `stop rule` according to each data structure

## Linear Search

- Search/traversal over a `linear data structure` (e.g., arrays) is also called **iteration**

## Binary Search
