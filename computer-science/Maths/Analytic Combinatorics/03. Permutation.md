# Permutation

- Permutation is a kind of arrangement where all the elements are used $n=p$

## Permutation Simple

- An arrangement where $n=p$

$$P_n = n!$$

## Permutation with repetition

- $n$: available number of elements
- $a,b,c$: number of times each component repeats
- Use cases: anagrams of words with repeating letters

$$A^{a,b}_{n} = \frac{n!}{a!*b!*c!}$$

## Permutation Circular

$$P^{circular}_n = (n-1)!$$
