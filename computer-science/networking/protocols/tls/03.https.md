# HTTPS

- `HTTP Package` consists of severeal headers
  1. TCP
  1. IP
  1. Ethernet II
  1. Frame

- Each header is built on top of the previous header

## Encryption

- In HTTPS, `symmetric encryption` is used for data transfer

- Why `RSA` (asymmetric) is not used in HTTPS
  - RSA encryption is slow
  - For bi-directional communication, RSA key pairs are required on both sides

## Cipher Suite

- Set of protocols to be used in the communication
  - `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256`
  - `TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256`
- `ECDHE`: Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellman Exchange
- `ECDSA`: Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm

## Deliverying key for encryption

### Without Diffie Hellman

- the TLS key is generated by the client
- The TLS key is encrypted with the server public key
- The TLS key encrypted is sent to the server

- Drawbacks!
  - The same rsa key pair of the server is used both for authentication and data encryption
  - RSA pair should be used only for authentication! Not for descryption

### With Diffie Hellman

- The public key of the server is NOT used for encryption
- The key for encryption is negotiate using diffie hellman algorithm

  - This algorithm generate keys over insecure public connection
  - Nevertherless only they know the keys generated!
  - Use one way function
    - **Modulus**: (g^a mod p)^b mod p = g^ab mod p // (g^b mod p)^a mod p = g^ba mod p
    - **Elliptic curve** (ECDHE): y^2 = x^3 + ax + b // m(nG) = n(mG)
