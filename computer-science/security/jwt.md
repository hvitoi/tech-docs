# JWT (JSON Web Token)

- It's a standard to codify a JSON object
- It's `not encrypted`, everyone can read
- It's `signed`, one can verify that its content authentic (that it was actually generated by a trustworthy authorization server)
- <https://www.jwt.io/>
- [RFC 7519](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519)

## Parts

- `header.payload.signature` (3 parts separated by dots)
- All three parts are `Base64URL-encoded`
- The signature is encoded for transport, but it's still a cryptographic digest, not plain data

## Libraries

- Python: <https://pypi.org/project/PyJWT/>
