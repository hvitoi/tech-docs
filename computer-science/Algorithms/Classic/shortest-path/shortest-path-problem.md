# Shortest Path Problem

- Computes the shortest `distance between two vertexes` considering the `weights of the edges`

## Dijkstra

- Only positive weights

## Bellman-Ford

- Algorithm created by Richard Bellman (same creator of dynamic programming)
- It can accommodate `negative weights`
- Runtime $O(n^2)$
