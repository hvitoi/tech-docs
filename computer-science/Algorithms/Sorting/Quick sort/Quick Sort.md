# Quick Sort

## Complexity

- Time complexity: $O(n\ log\ n)$
- Space complexity: $O(log\ n)$

## Steps

- We divide the list into halves every time, but we repeat the iteration N times (where N is the size of list).
- The running time consists of N loops (iterative or recursive) that are logarithmic, thus the algorithm is a combination of linear and logarithmic.
