# Selection Sort

## Complexity

- Time complexity: $O(n^2)$
- Space complexittL $O(1)$

## Steps

- Take the 1st element and compare it with all the other elements in the array, swap elements as needed it order to keep the lowest at the first position
- Repeat the process n times, on each new iteration, the pivot will be one position further
