# Merge Sort

## Complexity

- Time complexity: $O(n\ log\ n)$
  - $O(n)$ due to the concatenation of each half
  - $O(log\ n)$ due to the recursive sorting of each half
- Space complexity: $O(n)$
  - Each subarray created

## Steps

- Divide and conquer!

1. Array is divided in two halves and each is sorted
1. Two sorted halves are concatenated in the correct order
