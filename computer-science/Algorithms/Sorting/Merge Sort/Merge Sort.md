# Merge Sort

## Complexity

- Time complexity: $O(n\ log\ n)$
  - $log\ n$ due to the recursive sorting
  - $n$ due to the concatenation of each half
- Space complexity: $O(n)$
  - Each subarray created

## Steps

- Divide and conquer!

1. Array is divided in two halves and each is sorted
1. Two sorted halves are concatenated in the correct order
