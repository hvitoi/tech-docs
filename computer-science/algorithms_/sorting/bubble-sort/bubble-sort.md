# Bubble Sort

## Complexity

- Time complexity: $O(n^2)$
- Space complexittL $O(1)$

## Steps

- Look at each pair of numbers in the array (e.g. `#1 & #2`, `#2 & #3`, `#3 & #4`, ... )
- Check if the left element is greater than the right element, if yes, swap!
- After 1st iteration, the last element of the array will be the largest
- Repeat the process n-1 times (n = array length)
