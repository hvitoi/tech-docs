## Container Runtime Interface (CRI)

- CRI allows multiple container runtimes be compatible with Kubernetes

## Container Network Interface (CNI)

- CNI allows multiple network solutions be compatible with Kubernetes
- CNI is configured in the `kubelet`
- CNI defines how the plugin should be developed and how container runtimes should invoke them
- Plugins available
  - `bridge`
  - `vlan`
  - `ipvlan`
  - `macvlan`
  - `windows`
  - `dhcp` (3rd party)
  - `host-local` (3rd party)
- Example: bridge plugin
  - Container runtime must
    - Create network namespace
    - Identify network the container must attach to
    - Invoke the Network Plugin (bridge) when container is added
    - Invoke the Network Plugin (bridge) when container is deleted
    - JSON format of the network configuration
  - Network Plugin must
    - Support command line arguments (add, del, check)
    - Support parameters container id, network ns, etc
    - Manage IP address assignment to pods
    - Return results in a specific format

## Container Storage Interface (CSI)

- CNI allows multiple storage solutions be compatible with Kubernetes
- Allows any container orchestration tool to work with any storage vendor with supported plugin
- It defines a set of RPCs called by the container orchestrator and must be implemented by the storage drivers

- `CreateVolume`: Call (provision new volume) -> Should (provision new volume on the storage)
- `DeleteVolume`: Call (delete volume) -> Should (decommission a volume)
- `ControllerPublishVolume`: Call (place workload that uses volume onto a node) -> Should (make volume available on a node)
