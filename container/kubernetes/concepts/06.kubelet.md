# kubelet

- Agent that runs on each node (workers and masters)
- Attributions
  - Register node within the kubernetes cluster
  - Create PODs
  - Monitor node & PODs
- Listens instructions from the API server (E.g, deploy, destroy containers)
- kube-apiserver periodically fetches `status report` from the kubelet

## Static Pods

- `kubelet` continues to function even without the master node or any other worker nodes
- Without a master node, it has node connection with the kube-apiserver and therefore cannot receive instructions
- The kubelet can however create `static pods` by constantly reading manifests from a local directory `/etc/kubernetes/manifests`
  - This path is defined by the `pod-manifest-path` parameter
  - Or by specifying it in the `config.yaml` file (defined in the `config` parameter) with the `staticPodPath` option
- Static pods are also `mirrored` as objects in the kube-apiserver.
  - Mirrored objects are read-only and cannot be updated or deleted
  - Static pods can only be modified by means of the manifest folder
- Static pods are used to deploy the `control plan components` itself. As pods! (not conventional services). That's how kubeadm set up the cluster
  - That's why pods in `kube-system` namespace are shown, they are only mirrors to static the pods

## Setup

- `Kubelet` can only be installed manually! kubeadm does not install kubelet on worker nodes
- `kubelet.service` must be configured

```shell
# Download kubelet binary
wget "https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/v1.13.0/bin/linux/amd64/kubelet"
```

```conf
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/kubelet \\
  --config=/var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml \\
  --container-runtime=remote \\
  --container-runtime-endpoint=unix:///var/run/containerd/containerd/sock \\
  --pod-manifest-path=/etc/kubernetes/manifests \\
  --image-pull-progress-deadline=2m \\
  --kubeconfig=/var/lib/kubelet/kubeconfig \\
  --network-plugin=cni \\ # CNI
  --cni-conf-dir=/etc/cni/net.d \\ # CNI configuration directory
  --cni-bin-dir=/etc/cni/bin \\ # CNI binaries directory with all the supported plugins
  --register-node=true \\
  --v=2
```

```yaml
# kubelet-config.yaml
staticPodPath: /etc/kubernetes/manifests
```

- The options can be viewed at `/etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service`
- Or see the running options `px -aux | grep kubelet`
