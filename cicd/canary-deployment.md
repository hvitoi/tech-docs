# Canary Deployment

- With canaries, a new version of the application is slowly delivered to the user
- During the canary deployment, the old and new versions co-exist and its ratio (new/old) slowly increases as the new version proves safe
- Using canary we can detect new version issues early and reduce the blast radius (the number of users exposed to the faulty version)
