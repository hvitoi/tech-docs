# Data Structure

## Struct

- A way to organize a set of data
- E.g., name, age and address in a single data struct

## Linear List

- Each element is `preceded` and `succeeded` by another element
- Except the first one (no precessor) and the last one (no successor)
- Lists have an `order`

- **Sequential Linear List**
  - The `physical order` (memory) is the same as the `logical order` (viewed by the user)
  - The elements or the list are neighboors in memory
