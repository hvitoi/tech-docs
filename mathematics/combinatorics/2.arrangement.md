# Arrangement

- The `number of possibilities` to form an `ordered subgroup` with `no repetitions`
- Also known as
  - **k-permutations of n**
  - **partial permutation**
  - **sequence without repetition**
  - **variation**

## Formula

- $n$: available number of elements
- $k$: total elements in the subgroup

$$A_{n,k} = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!}$$

## Other symbols

$$A_{n,k} = P(n,k) = _{n}P_{k} = (n)_{k} = n ^{\underline{k}}$$

## Example

- You have a set `{1, 2, 3, 4}` ($n = 4$) and you need to find all possible ordered subgroups of size 2 ($k = 2$), you would have the following subsets:
- 12 possibilities!

```txt
{1, 2}
{1, 3}
{1, 4}

{2, 1}
{2, 3}
{2, 4}

{3, 1}
{3, 2}
{3, 4}

{4, 1}
{4, 2}
{4, 3}
```

## Arrangement with repetition

- An arrangement with repetitions allowed
- Also known as
  - **k-tuples**
  - **permutations with repetition** (although it's not a permutation in the usual sense)
