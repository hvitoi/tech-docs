# Training Data

- To train our model we must have good data
- `Garbage in` => `Garbage out`

## Labeled vs. Unlabeled Data

- **Labeled data** has input features and the corresponding output labels
  - It gives a clue on what the data is about
  - With labeled data you can apply `supervised learning` where the model is trained to map inputs to known outputs

- **Unlabeled data** is just raw data
  - With unlabeled data you can apply `unsupervised learning`, the algorithm itself tries by itself to find pattern in the data and group them together

## Structured vs. Unstructured Data

- **Structured Data** is structured in a predefined format
  - E.g., csv file, time series data

- **Unstructured Data** doesn't follow a specific structure
  - It's usually text-heavy or multimedia content
  - Text data: articles, social media posts, customer reviews
  - Image data: just pixels
