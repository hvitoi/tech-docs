# Github Copilot

- GitHub Copilot is an AI-powered coding assistant developed by `GitHub` in collaboration with `OpenAI`.
- It helps developers by suggesting code snippets, functions, and even entire blocks of code based on the context of the code you're writing.
- Copilot is designed to integrate with popular code editors like Visual Studio Code (VSCode), JetBrains IDEs, and others.
- GitHub Copilot is powered by `OpenAI's Codex`, a machine learning model trained on a massive amount of publicly available code (including repositories from GitHub).
