# Sharding / Partitioning

- Slipt the data (not replicate) among several database instances

- **Pros**
  - Distribute the load evenly
  - Increase throughput
- **Cons**
  - Adds overhead of traffic routing
  - Do not solve failure recovery situations

- Sharding can also be applied for the whole infrastructure
  - Example 1: premium users requests go to faster machines
  - Example 2: the whole user base is split to reduce potential blast radius
