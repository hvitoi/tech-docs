- **Key-Value DB**
  - Data stored in RAM
  - No schema
  - Implementations
    - Redis
    - Memcached
    - Etcd
- **Wide-Column DB**
  - Keys store multiple columns (values)
  - No schema
  - Good for time-series data, historical records, high-write, low-read
  - Implementations
    - Cassandra
    - HBase
- **Document Oriented DB**
  - Each document is a container for key-value pairs
  - No schema
  - Documents are grouped together in collections
  - Implementations
    - MongoDB
    - Firestore
    - DynamoDB
    - CouchDB
- **Relational DB**
  - Has schema
  - ACID compliant
    - `Atomicity`: The outcome of a transaction can either be completely successful or completely unsuccessful. The whole transaction must be rolled back if one part of it fails.
    - `Consistency`: Transactions maintain integrity restrictions by moving the database from one valid state to another.
    - `Isolation`: Concurrent transactions are isolated from one another, assuring the accuracy of the data.
    - `Durability`: Once a transaction is committed, its modifications remain in effect even in the event of a system failure.
  - Difficult to scale
  - Implementations
    - MySQL
    - Postgres
    - SQL Server
- **Graph DB**
  - Data is represented as `nodes` (circles)
  - Relationships are represented as `edges` (arrows)
  - Edges can also be weighted
  - Good for n:n relationships!
  - Good for fraud detection in finance and recomendation systems
  - Implementations
    - Neo4j
    - DGraph
- **Search DB**
  - Similar to document-oriented DBs
  - Search DB analyze all the text in the document and create index of the searchable terms
  - Good for type-ahead search bars
  - Implementations
    - Lucene
    - Solr
    - ElasticSearch
    - Algolia
    - MeiliSearch
- **Multi Model DB**
  - Implementations
    - Fauna: describe how to access the data with GraphQL
