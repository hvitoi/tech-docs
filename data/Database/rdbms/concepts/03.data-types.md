# Data Types

## Numeric Types

- **int**
  - Whole number
  - Max 4.294.967.295 (4 billions)
- decimal
  - DECIMAL(5,2): max 99999.99
  - Calculations are exact, it's a fixed-point type!
  - Decimal is always the best choice if precision matters.
- float
  - Calculations are approximate. Numbers are real!
  - Store larger numbers using less space
  - Less precise than decimal
- double
  - Basically the same as float but more precise! And double memory needed.
- tinyint
- smallint
- mediumint
- bigint
- numeric
- bit

## String Types

- **varchar**
  - Between 1 and 255 characters
  - varchar (100): 100 is the max length
- char
  - Char has a fixed length!
  - Var(10) will always have exactly 10 chars
  - Good for fixed length text: E.g. CA, NY, MG, Y/N, M/F
- binary
- varbinary
- blob
- tinyblob
- medium blob
- longblob
- text
- tinytext
- mediumtext
- longtext
- enum

## Date Types

- date
  -YYYY-MM-DD
- time
  - HH:MM:SS
- datetime
  - YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS
- timestamp
  - Same as datetime, but...
  - from 1970 until 2038
  - Only 4 bytes (compared to 8 in datetime)
  - It's most used for info about created_at, updated_at ...
  - NEVER used for birth dates
- year

## Character

- Fixed character: char
- Fixed-length character strings: char(n)
  - Spaces will be added to remaining space
  - Values longer than the length retrive error
- Variable-length character strings: varchar(n)
  - Store up to n characters
  - No spaces if value is shorter than the length
- Number
- Integer
  - smallint: 2-byte int. (-32768; 32767)
  - int: 4-byte int. (-214783648; 214783647)
  - serial: same as int, but already populated into the column
    - Similar to AUTO_INCREMENT in DBMS
- Floating-point numbers
  - float(n): precision up to n, maximum of 8 bytes
  - real / float8: double-precision. 8-byte number
  - numeric / numeric(p,s): p digits, s numbers after decimal point
  - numeric(p,): the exact number
- Temporal
  - date
  - time
  - timestamp: data and time
  - interval: difference in timestamps
  - timestamp: timestamp and timezone data
- Special Types
  - Array
