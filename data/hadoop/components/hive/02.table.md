# Table

## Managed Table

- On `managed tables`, the original data is copied/moved into Hive
- `Schema On Read`: Hive takes unstructured data and apply its schema as it's being read

```sql
CREATE TABLE ratings (
  userId INT,
  movieId INT,
  rating INT,
  time INT
)
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
  FIELDS TERMINATED BY '\t'
  STORED AS TEXTFILE;

-- Schema for the raw file imported (it will be applied when data is read)
-- The data is never imported. The schema and how to parse it that is created
LOAD DATA LOCAL INPATH '${env:HOME}/ml/100k/ratings.csv'
OVERWRITE INTO TABLE ratings
```

- `LOCAL DATA`: moves data from RDFS into Hive
- `LOCAL DATA LOCAL`: copies data from local fs into Hive (not dealing with big data)

## External Table

- A table to be accessed lives outside of Hive
- Hive doesn't take ownership of the original data
- The original data is left untouched

```sql
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE IF NOT EXISTS ratings (
  userId INT,
  movieId INT,
  rating INT,
  time INT
)
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
  FIELDS TERMINATED BY '\t'
  LOCATION '/data/ml-100k/movies.csv';
```
