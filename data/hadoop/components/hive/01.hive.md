# Hive

- Allows fetching data from `HDFS` using SQL queries
- Hive can be used with MapReduce or Tez to fetch the data
- It's a translation layer from SQL to MapReduce/Tez commands
- Uses `HiveSQL`

## Drawbacks

- Simple `OLAP` queries! (read operations). Bad for OLTP (write operations)
- Stores data `de-normalized`
- Limited to what SQL can do (pig, spark allows more complex stuff)
- No transactions

## Using Hive

- Hive CLI
- Saved query files (`hive -f /home/user/queries.hql`)
- Ambari / Hue
- JDBC/ODBC server
- Thrift service (even though hive is not suitable for OLTP)
- Via Oozie
