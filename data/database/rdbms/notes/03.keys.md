# Keys

- Primary key (PK)
  - A field (column) or group of fields that is used to identify the row uniquely
  - PK is UNIQUE and NOT NULL
- Foreign key (FK)
  - A field that uniquely identifies a record in another table
  - Refers to the PK of the other table
  - Table with the FK: referencing table / child table
  - Table with the PK: referenced table / parent table
  - A table can have multiple foreign keys
  - FK and the referenced PK must MATCH!
  - By defining a field as FK, each record in the column must have a reference in the parent table
  - PK can be NULL!
