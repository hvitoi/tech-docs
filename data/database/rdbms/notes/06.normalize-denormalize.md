# Normalization

## Normalized data

- `Minimizes storage` spaces
- Requires `two queries` to get data from different sources (tables, collections)
- Easy to perform updates! Need to change only one source of data
- Good approach when the data storage is expensive! And the performance is not important
  - Doubles the traffic with double queries (two transactions)! Increseases latency

## Denormalized data

- Data is duplicated in order for a source to container all the information needed!
- Only requires one transaction to fetch the complete data
- Improves the performance!
- Downside is that in order to update data, many sources must be updated
