# CAP Theory

- Cannot have always the 3 of them!
- It's a concern of distributed databases

- **Consistency**
  - All clients see the same view of data even right after update or delete
  - Client always has the same view of the data
  - All values are the same for any machine or request
- **Availability**
  - All clients can find a replica of data, even in case of partial node failures
  - Non-technical error response for read/write request even in the event of not having the latest data
  - System available for read/write requests
- **Partitioning** (Network Partition Tolerance)
  - The system continues to wokr as expected, even in presence of partial network failure
  - System continues to operate despite network partition

## CP

- The write is incomplete until it’s replicated to all the other machines
- But what if at the write there was a partition failure? Write will never be complete
- Availability not be reached!

- `Examples`

  - HBase, MongoDB, Redis, BigTable
  - Distributed Locking (Apache Zookeeper)
  - Majority protocols

- `Traits`

  - Pessimistic locking
  - Make minority partitions unavailable

## AP

- The failed server will not be updated
- Failed server will show outdated results
- Consistency not reached!

- `Examples`

  - Cassandra, Riak, CouchDB
  - DNS

- `Traits`

  - NSPF (No Single Point of Failure)
  - Conflict resolution
  - Optimistic

## CA

- In a single RDB it’s already possible
- Partitioning is not reached!

- Examples
  - Relational databases (Oracle, Mysql, Postgresql, Microsoft SQL Server, IBM DB/2)
