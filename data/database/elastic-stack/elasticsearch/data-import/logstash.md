# Logstash

- Logstash `parses`, `transforms` and `filters` data as it passes through
- It can:
  - `derive structure` from unstructured data
  - `anonymize personal data` or exclude it entirely
  - `geo-location` lookups
  - `scale` across nodes
- Allows a huge variety of data `sources` and `destinations`
