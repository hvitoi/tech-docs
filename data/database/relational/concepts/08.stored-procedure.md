# Stored Procedures

- A stored procedure is a prepared SQL code that you can save, so the code can be reused over and over again
- You can also pass parameters to a stored procedure, so that the stored procedure can act based on the parameter value(s) that is passed

```shell
CREATE PROCEDURE procedure_name
AS
SELECT * FROM Customers
GO;
```
