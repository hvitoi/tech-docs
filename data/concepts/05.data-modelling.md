# Data modeling

- Table for `Actors`
- E.g., store, customer, seller

- Table for `Actions` of actors
- E.g., customers make orders, complains, returns

- Table for `properties of actors` that don’t fit to 2D diagram
- E.g., possible payment methods for customer

- Table for `properties of actions` that don’t fit to 2D diagram
- E.g., possible reasons for return

- `Optimization`
  - _Normalization_: separate tables for redundancy reduction
    - E.g., doc, doctor, med doc
    - Cons: You know less from only one table. Have to read more than one table
  - _Denormalization_: application of JOINS to integrate tables
