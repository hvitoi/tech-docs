# Distributed File Storage

- Just like storing files in a local hard drive, except that the multiple storage devices connected via network
- Files/Folders structure

- Features
  - `Replication`
  - `Strong/Eventual Consistency`
  - `Autohealing`

- **Pros**
  - There is no need to use a special API, it's just like a conventional file access
  - Great for logging purpose (appending to file)
  - Great for high throughput use cases
- **Cons**
  - The number of files is limited in a filesystem (e.g., ext4)
  - No easy access through web APIs (e.g., serving a static web content)
