# # TensorFlow Basics
#
# Remember to reference the video for full explanations, this is just a notebook for code reference.
#
# You can import the library:

# %%
# import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow.compat.v1 as tf

tf.disable_v2_behavior()

# %%
print(tf.__version__)

# %% [markdown]
# ### Simple Constants
#
# Let's show how to create a simple constant with Tensorflow, which TF stores as a tensor object:

# %%
hello = tf.constant("Hello World")

# %%
type(hello)

# %%
x = tf.constant(100)

# %%
type(x)

# %% [markdown]
# ### Running Sessions
#
# Now you can create a TensorFlow Session, which is a class for running TensorFlow operations.
#
# A `Session` object encapsulates the environment in which `Operation`
# objects are executed, and `Tensor` objects are evaluated. For example:

# %%
sess = tf.Session()

# %%
sess.run(hello)

# %%
type(sess.run(hello))

# %%
sess.run(x)

# %%
type(sess.run(x))

# %% [markdown]
# ## Operations
#
# You can line up multiple Tensorflow operations in to be run during a session:

# %%
x = tf.constant(2)
y = tf.constant(3)

# %%
with tf.Session() as sess:
    print("Operations with Constants")
    print("Addition", sess.run(x + y))
    print("Subtraction", sess.run(x - y))
    print("Multiplication", sess.run(x * y))
    print("Division", sess.run(x / y))

# %% [markdown]
# ### Placeholder
#
# You may not always have the constants right away, and you may be waiting for a constant to appear after a cycle of operations. **tf.placeholder** is a tool for this. It inserts a placeholder for a tensor that will be always fed.
#
# **Important**: This tensor will produce an error if evaluated. Its value must be fed using the `feed_dict` optional argument to `Session.run()`,
# `Tensor.eval()`, or `Operation.run()`. For example, for a placeholder of a matrix of floating point numbers:
#
#     x = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=(1024, 1024))
#
# Here is an example for integer placeholders:

# %%
x = tf.placeholder(tf.int32)
y = tf.placeholder(tf.int32)

# %%
x

# %%
type(x)

# %% [markdown]
# ### Defining Operations

# %%
add = tf.add(x, y)
sub = tf.subtract(x, y)
mul = tf.multiply(x, y)

# %% [markdown]
# Running operations with variable input:

# %%
d = {x: 20, y: 30}

# %%
with tf.Session() as sess:
    print("Operations with Constants")
    print("Addition", sess.run(add, feed_dict=d))
    print("Subtraction", sess.run(sub, feed_dict=d))
    print("Multiplication", sess.run(mul, feed_dict=d))

# %% [markdown]
# Now let's see an example of a more complex operation, using Matrix Multiplication. First we need to create the matrices:

# %%
import numpy as np

# Make sure to use floats here, int64 will cause an error.
a = np.array([[5.0, 5.0]])
b = np.array([[2.0], [2.0]])

# %%
a

# %%
a.shape

# %%
b

# %%
b.shape

# %%
mat1 = tf.constant(a)

# %%
mat2 = tf.constant(b)

# %% [markdown]
# The matrix multiplication operation:

# %%
matrix_multi = tf.matmul(mat1, mat2)

# %% [markdown]
# Now run the session to perform the Operation:

# %%
with tf.Session() as sess:
    result = sess.run(matrix_multi)
    print(result)

# %% [markdown]
# That is all for now! Next we will expand these basic concepts to construct out own Multi-Layer Perceptron model!
