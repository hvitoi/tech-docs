# Object Store

- Scalable storage solution for storing unstructure data at internet scale
- Objects in a object store are `immutable`
  - It can only be replaced, but never appended
- Access through either an SDK or the provided REST API
- Low throughput/IO performance compared to distributed file storage

## Buckets

- It's store in containers called `Buckets` (not file/folder structure)
- There is no limit to the number of objects we can store in a bucket
- High file size limit (~5-10 TB)

## Versioning

- Providers `versioning` out of the box
- It's possible to rollback to a previous state

## REST API Interface

- Provide an HTTP + `Rest API interface` out of the box
- Useful for delivering static web content directly

## Tiering

- The stored files have a tier for performance/costs tradeoffs

1. Standard (hot access)
1. Nearline (infrequent access)
1. Coldline (very infrequent access)
1. Archive (rare access)
