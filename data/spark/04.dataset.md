# Dataset

- In Spark 1.x, the `RDD` was the primary application programming interface (API), but as of Spark 2.x use of the `Dataset` API is encouraged
- The RDD technology is not deprecated though, it still underlies the Dataset API

## Dataframe

- The `Dataframe` API was released as an abstraction on top of the RDD when the Dataset API didn't yet exist
- With a DataFrame object you can run SQL queries
- Always prefer Datasets when possible (not Dataframe)
