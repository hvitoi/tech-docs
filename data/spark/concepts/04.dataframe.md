# Dataframe

- The `Dataframe` API was released as an abstraction on top of the RDD when the Dataset API didn't yet exist
- With a Dataframe object you can run SQL queries
- Always prefer Datasets when possible (not Dataframe)

## Schema

- A Dataframe is a DataSet of Row objects (`DataSet[Row]`)
- The schema is inferred at runtime
