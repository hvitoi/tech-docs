# Service Levels

- **Service Level Agreement** (SLA)

  - An agreement between the `service provider` and the `clients/users`
  - A legal contract that represents quality of the service. With explicit penalties and financial consequences
  - E.g.,
    - Availability
    - Performance
    - Data durability
    - Time to respond to system failures
  - SLAs are common for external paying users (always), free external users (sometimes) and internal users (occasionally)

- **Service Level Objetives** (SLO)

  - Individual goals set for the system
  - Each SLO represents a target value/range that the system needs to meet
  - E.g.,
    - Availability of 3 nines
    - Response time of 100 ms for 90th percentile
  - The quality attributes from the beginning of the design process will make their way to one or more SLOs
  - If a system has an SLA, it will be detailed as multiple SLOs aggregated in a single legal document

- **Service Level Indicator** (SLI)

  - Quantitative measure of the compliance with a SLO
  - The actual numbers, metrics measured by monitoring a service
  - SLOs rely on the SLIs to measure if the goal is achieved or not
