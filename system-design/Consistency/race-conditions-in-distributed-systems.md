# Handling race condition

- If two instances try to acquire and change a resource at the same time, it may lead to consistent states
- Example: two people try to book a seat at the same time

## Transactions

- In databases, `transactions` provide `ACID properties` (atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability)
- This way, it's guaranteed that two instances won't update a value simultaneously

## Conditional Writes

- Performs a check before updating an item
- This way, the race condition (caused by the select + update) is handled by the database iself

## Optimistic Locking

- Each `write operation` includes a `version` or `timestamp`.
- Before updating the data, check whether the version or timestamp has changed since the data was retrieved
- If it has changed, it indicates that another operation has modified the data, and appropriate actions can be taken, such as retrying the operation or notifying the user.

## Pessimistic Locking

- This involves `locking the data resource exclusively` when it is being worked on by a service or thread
- While effective in preventing race conditions, it can also lead to `scalability and performance issues`, as it may introduce contention among multiple services or threads.

## Idempotent Operations

- Design operations to be idempotent, meaning that performing the operation multiple times has the same effect as performing it once.
- This allows retries of failed operations without causing unintended side effects or data inconsistencies

## Eventual Consistency

: Embrace the concept of eventual consistency, where data replicas may temporarily diverge but eventually converge to a consistent state. Design services to handle eventual consistency gracefully by implementing conflict resolution mechanisms and reconciliation processes.

## Circuit Breaker Pattern

: Implement circuit breaker patterns to prevent cascading failures caused by race conditions. When a service detects that a downstream service is experiencing issues, it can temporarily halt requests to that service, preventing further degradation of the system.

## Message Queues

: Use message queues to decouple services and manage the flow of data between them. By ensuring that messages are processed in the correct order and only once, message queues can help prevent race conditions that arise from concurrent data updates.

## Monitoring and Logging

: Implement comprehensive monitoring and logging to detect and diagnose race conditions in real-time. Monitor system metrics, such as throughput, latency, and error rates, and log relevant information to facilitate troubleshooting and root cause analysis.
