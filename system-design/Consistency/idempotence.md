# Idempotence

- Have a transaction ID to skip transactions that have already been performed

## Message Deduplication

- Maintain a record of processed message identifiers (e.g., message offsets, `transaction id` or other unique message identifiers)
- Use this record to deduplicate incoming messages before processing them.
- If a message with a known identifier is received, simply ignore it to prevent duplicate processing.

## Idempotent Storage Operations

- If processing involves updating external state (e.g., databases or external services), use idempotent storage operations to ensure that updates are idempotent.
- This may involve using unique identifiers or conditional updates to prevent duplicate modifications.

## Dead-Letter Queues (DLQ)

- Configure a DLQ to capture messages that cannot be processed due to idempotence violations or other errors.
- By redirecting problematic messages to a DLQ, you can isolate and analyze issues without affecting the main message processing flow.

## Exactly-Once Semantics

- Leverage Kafka's support for exactly-once semantics (EOS) to ensure that messages are processed exactly once, even in the presence of failures or retries.
- Enable EOS for both producers and consumers to achieve end-to-end exactly-once processing guarantees.

## Testing and Validation

- Thoroughly test consumer logic to ensure that it behaves correctly under various conditions, including message retries, failures, and edge cases.
- Use techniques such as unit testing, integration testing, and fault injection to validate idempotent behavior.
