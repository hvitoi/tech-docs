# Open AI

- Sam Altman worked at `Y Combinator` (a business incubator)
- With that business acumen, he got funding to OpenAI in 2015
- At first it was a non-profit organization
- In order to attract talents, the promise was that there was no need to generate profit
  - The opposite of Google was doing with DeepMind
  - This liberty proposal was important because AI researchers believe AI can be the greatest or worst invention of humanity, depending on how it is applied
  - `p(doom)`: probability of bad outcomes of AI
  - `Boomers`: AI can only bring good results
  - `Doomers`: AI will collapse and extinguish humanity
- When OpenAI became for profit
  - Sam Altman became CEO
  - Elon Musk was kicked out and founded xAI
  - Dario Amodei left and founded Anthropic
