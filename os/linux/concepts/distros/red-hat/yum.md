- First remove all the repo list from `/etc/yum.repos.d/`
- `/media/hvitoi/CentOS 7 x86_64/Packages`: CentOS rpm packages from official dvd.

  - Copy all these packages to any folder e.g. `/localrepo`

- Create a new local repo `local.repo` in `/etc/yum.repos.d/`

```txt
[centos7]
name=centos7
baseurl=file:///localrepo/
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0
```

```sh
# Create the repo containing the rpm packages locally
createrepo /localrepo

# Clear cache from the old repository
yum clean all

# List all repos
yum list all
```
