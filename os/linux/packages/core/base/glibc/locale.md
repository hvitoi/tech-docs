# locale

- Locales are used by glibc and other `locale-aware programs` or libraries for rendering

  - Text
  - Correctly displaying regional monetary values
  - Time and date formats
  - Alphabetic idiosyncrasies
  - And other locale-specific standards

- Format `language[_territory][.codeset][@modifier]` (e.g., en_US.UTF8")
- Before a locale can be enabled on the system it must be generated by `locale-gen`

```shell
# currently set locale and its related environmental settings
locale

# list all enabled locales (as generated by locale-gen)
locale -a
```

## Locale Files
