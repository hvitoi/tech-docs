# chown - Change ownership

- There are 2 owners of a filer or directory
  - User
  - Group

```shell
# Change user ownership
sudo chown "new-user-owner" "file"
sudo chown -R "new-user-owner" "folder" # Recursive

# Change user and group ownership
sudo chown "new-user":"new-group" "file"
sudo chown hvitoi:root texto.txt
```

- Only root can change user and group ownership
- A file can be deleted even if the user has no permission to access it if the folder that contains it has the propper permissions
