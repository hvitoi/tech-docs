- Define the metrics that matter
- Define the expected range for those metrics (what a healthy service looks like)
- Define the action to take when we can't provide the expected service

## Service Level Indicators (SLI)

  - `error rate`
  - `system throughput`
  - `availability`/`yield`: well formed requested that succeeded. (99.95%: 3 nines and a half)
