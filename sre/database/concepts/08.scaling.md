# Scaling

- `Vertical scaling`
- `Horizontal scaling`
  - Machines added to network
  - Distributed databases
  - Tables broken into partitions. Each partition in a machine

## Replication

- Replication allows `horizontal scaling` and therefore a high throughput distributed among several databases

- **Replication Factor**
  - RF 3. Any time data is written itâ€™s copied 3 times in other machines.
  - Copy = Replica
