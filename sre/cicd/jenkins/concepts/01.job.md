# Jenkins job

- A `job` is a task to be performed
- Show job: </job/job-name>
- List of all built-in envs </env-vars.html>

## Create job

- Create job: </view/all/newJob>
  - Give it any name
  - Freestyle project

## Trigger

- A job can be triggered `manually` at </job/job-name/build>
- If an execution fails it will show as a red ball
- `Cronjobs` can also be configured to trigger automatically

### External trigger

- To trigger `externally`, permissions must be set in order to trigger
- Invoke </job/job-name/build?delay=0sec> with a `crumb`!
- `CSRF protection` must be enabled under </configureSecurity> in order to generate a crumb

```shell
# Get a jenkins-crumb token!
crumb=curl "http://localhost:8080/crumbIssuer/api/xml?xpath=concat(//crumbRequestField,':',//crumb)" -u "admin:123"

# Trigger job with a crumb (no parameters)
curl -X "POST" "http://localhost:8080/job/job-name/build?delay=0sec" -u "admin:123" -H "$crumb"

# Trigger job with a crumb (with parameters)
curl -X "POST" "http://localhost:8080/job/job-name/buildWithParameters?DB_HOST=db&DB_NAME=testdbql" -u "admin:123" -H "$crumb"
```

```shell
# Trigger job with a token (no parameters)
curl "http://localhost:8080/job/job-name/build?token=mytoken" -u "admin:123"  # Token is configured in the item configuration

# Trigger job with a token (with parameters)
curl "http://localhost:8080/job/job-name/buildWithParameters?token=mytoken&DB_HOST=db&DB_NAME=testdbql" -u "admin:123"
```

## Job DSL

- It's a good practice to version your `DSL` in a git repository
- This way, your `seed job` cab be builded automatically (via git hooks) every time a DSL is updated in the git repository
- Building the seed job with the updated DSL will update the child job
- For that `script security for Job DSL scripts` must be disabled under </configureSecurity>
  - This option enabled prevents DSL from being loaded from a local file

## Pipelines

- A `multi-branch pipeline` is a "folder" generates a job for each git branch that contains a pipeline
