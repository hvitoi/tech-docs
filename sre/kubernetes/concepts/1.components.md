# Kubernetes

- <https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/>

- A Kubernetes cluster has two types of nodes (virtual machines)
  - `Worker nodes`: host the containers and the workloads
  - `Master nodes`: it's the controller
    - _Manage_, _plan_, _schedule_, _monitor_ the worker nodes.
    - It receives the instructions from the config file.
    - Master node has the control plane components

## Master Nodes (Control Plane)

- Control Plane Components are deployed as `static pods` on each master node (that means there are 4 manifests in /etc/kubernetes/manifests)
- Master Nodes also have `kubelet`, `kube-proxy`

- **etcd**: k8s.gcr.io/etcd:3.4.13-0
- **kube-apiserver**: k8s.gcr.io/kube-apiserver:v1.21.2
- **kube-controller-manager**: k8s.gcr.io/kube-controller-manager:v1.21.2
- **kube-scheduler**: k8s.gcr.io/kube-scheduler:v1.21.2

## Worker Nodes

- **kubelet**: deployed manually as a Service
- **kube-proxy**: deployed as a DaemonSet
- **coredns**: dns server
- **container runtime**
