# Istio architecture

![Istio architecture](./images/istio-architecture.svg)

## Control Plane

- The control plane is the `Istio Daemon` (istiod): Manage and inject envoy proxies
- As of istio v1.5, multiple components (Galley, citadel, pilot, mixer) were condensed into a single component `istiod`

  - **Galley**: Reads the k8s format and transform into the istio format
  - **Pilot**: Reads internal istio format and transform into envoy format (to be sent to proxies)
  - **Citadel**:Manage TLS certificates! Enable TLS/SSL across the entire cluster
  - **Mixer**: Implements policy checks (policy pod) and telemetry (telemetry pod)

- Istio `ingress gateway` and `egress gateway` are also part of the control plane

## Data plane

- `Data plane` is composed by intelligent `proxies` (envoy)
- Data plane is managed by the control plane
- Isto proxy is a helper container
- `Envoy`, `sidecar`, `proxy` in Istio means the same!

- Istio creates a `proxy` container inside of each pod. The proxy would be a ClusterIP in convention k8s networking
- Proxies are collectively called the `Data Plane` in Istio
- Everything else is called `Control Plane`: telemetry, pilot, tracing, etc

## Other components

- **Grafana**: Frontend interface for telemetry
- **Jaeger**: Tracing
- **Kiali**: Frontend interface for telemetry
- **Prometheus**: Scrape metrics to be presented in a good form
