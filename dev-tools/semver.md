# Semantic Versioning (semver)

- <https://semver.org/>
- Common approach of numbering software versions.
- `5.1.3` -> Major: 5, Minor: 1, Patch: 3

  - `Major`: New feature incompatible with previous versions
  - `Minor`: Small feature that doesn't break anything in previous version
  - `Patch`: Small bug fix

- **Pre-release version**
  - `5.1.3-1.3`: release version: 5.1.3, pre-release version: 1.3
  - `Release candidate (rc)`: It's a preview of the official version (which is launched afterwards). E.g. 2.0.0-rc.2
  - `Beta versions`: beta feature
