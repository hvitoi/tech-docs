# Football stats

- This app extracts, parses and analyses a database of football matches

## Functionalities

- Enumerations (enums): to signal a important property that is not clearly legible to other engineers
- Separate files for code reuse
- Use abstract classes
- Use of generics <> to implement a generic class
- An implementation using inheritance and another using composition (last)
- Implement an data analysis summary with composition
- Use of static methods to invoke methods without instantiating the class
