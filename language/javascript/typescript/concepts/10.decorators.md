# Decorators

- Modify different `properties`,`methods` and `accessors` in a class
- Not equal to JS decorators
- Inside classes ONLY
- `"experimentalDecorators": true` and `"emitDecoratorMetadata": true` must be enabled in tsconfig.json
- It is executed only ONE time when class is created and not when it is instantiated

```typescript
function logError(target: any, key: string, desc: PropertyDescriptor): void {
  console.log(target); // Prototype of the class (properties won't appear because they are created in the constructor). Prototype only stores methods definitions
  console.log(key); // key of the class: method, property or accessor
  console.log(desc); // property descriptions (Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor)
}
```

- When a decorator is wrapper inside of a function it's called a Decorator factory
- It allows additional arguments to be passed
