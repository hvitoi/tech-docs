# Classes

- Extends: Inherits all properties and methods from parent class

## Extends

- Extends another class
- Inherits the methods from a parent class

```javascript
class Car extends Vehicle {}
class NumbersCollection extends Sorter {}
```

## Implements

- Implements a interface
- Assure that the class obeys the interface
- Check if class satisfies all the requisites in an interface

```javascript
class User implements Mappable {}
class NumbersCollection implements Sortable {}
```

## Abstract classes

- Classes that cannot be instantiated directly!
- Only used as a parent class
- Methods can refer to methods that don't exist yet
- Child classes must 'promise' to implement theses methods

```javascript
abstract class Sorter {
  abstract compare(leftIndex: number, rightIndex: number): boolean;
  abstract swap(leftIndex: number, rightIndex: number): void;
  abstract length: number;
}
```

- Abstract keyword mark methods that will be defined in the child class

## super()

- super() must be called inside of the constructor of a child class
- super() is a reference to the constructor of the parent class
- super() don't need to be called if the child does not have a constructor defined

```typescript
export class CharactersCollection extends Sorter {
  constructor(public data: string) {
    super();
  }
}
```

## Static methods

- Invoke a method without instantiating the class

```typescript
class Food {
  // Static Property
  static description = 'This class represents foods!';

  // Static method
  static printDescription() {
    console.log(this.description);
  }
}
```
