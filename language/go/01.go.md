# Go

## Installation

```shell
brew install go
```

## Analysis tools

- Analysis tools are installed at `$GOPATH/bin` where `$GOPATH=$HOME/go`
- The vscode extension `golang.go` installs all the required tools automatically on the go path

  - `staticcheck`
  - `gopkgs`
  - `go-outline`
  - `dlv`

```shell
# Language Server from Google
go get -v "golang.org/x/tools/gopls"

# Linter
go get -v "honnef.co/go/tools/cmd/staticcheck"

# Go debugger (Delve)
go get -v "github.com/go-delve/delve/cmd/dlv"

go get -v "github.com/uudashr/gopkgs/v2/cmd/gopkgs"
go get -v "github.com/ramya-rao-a/go-outline"
```

## Packages

- Standard library packages: <https://pkg.go.dev/std>
- 3rd party packages: <https://pkg.go.dev/>

## Running code

- Only a "main package" (with a "main function") can is self executable

```shell
# the filename doesn't matter as long as it is a "main package" with a "main function"
go run foo.go
```

## Pass by value

- Go is a `pass by value` language. It means that when a function is called, the function receives a copy of the argument
- Any modifications made inside of the function do not affect the original variable outside of the function

- **Value Types**
  - In order to modify the original variable, pointers need to be manually specified by means of `&` and `*`
  - _int_
  - _float_
  - _string_
  - _bool_
  - _struct_
  - _array_

- **Reference types**
  - Reference types are already references to an address in memory. Therefore there is usually no need to manipulate pointers with them, given that both copies point to the same underlying array
  - _Slice_: has a `ptr to head` of the actual array, a `capacity` and a `length`
  - _Map_
  - _Channel_
  - _Pointer_
  - _Function_
