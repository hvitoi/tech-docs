# Loops

## For

- In `for loops`, the first element is always the `index` and the second is the `element`

```go
for i, card := range cards {
  fmt.Println(i, card)
}
```

- If you don't intend to use to index, set it as \_

```go
for _, suit := range cardSuits {
  for _, value := range cardValues {
    cards = append(cards, value+" of "+suit)
  }
}
```
