# Go Routines

- Go routines is a way to spawn code so that it can be run in parallel or concurrently

## The Main Routine

- The `main routine` is the top-level routine on your program. Other routines can be spawn from it
- Other routines are called `child routines` and are created using the `go` keyword

## Go scheduler

- The routines are managed by the `Go scheduler` which uses by default all the available cores at your machine
- The go scheduler manages the go routines by applying `context switching` (interrupting some routines and resuming others)
  - The context switching is usually executed when the routine is in a wait state (e.g., http calls)
  - With these concurrency techniques the overall utilization of a single thread is improved

## Channels

- It's a hub for communication between go routines
- Channels are typed. The messages sent through a channel must be of the same type
