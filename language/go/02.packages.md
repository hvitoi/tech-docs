# Packages

- The first line of every go file contains the package it belongs to
- There are two types of packages

  - `Executable`: Generates a file that we can run. **main** is the only executable package. The main package must define a main function, which will be executed
  - `Reusable`: Code used as helpers. Reusable logic

- Standard library packages: <golang.org/pkg>

```go
package main // Package name

import "fmt" // Import 'format' package

func main() {
  fmt.Println("Hi there!")
}
```

- Files in the same package can freely call functions defined in other files

```go
package main

func main() {
    printState()
}
```

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func printState() {
    fmt.Println("California")
}
```
