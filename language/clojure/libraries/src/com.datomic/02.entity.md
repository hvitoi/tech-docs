# Basics

- Stores historical events
- `Datalog` is the query language
- Append-only (impossible to edit/remove events)

## Entity

- `Entity` is every symbol created by a datom
- Each entity is referenced with a `unique id` (`:db/id`). This id is automatically created

## Schema

- Schema is the `set of attributes` that can be associated with the entities of a database
- An `attribute` is defined by:
  - `:db/ident`: unique name for the attribute
  - `:db/valueType`: type of data to be stored in the attribute
  - `:db/cardinality`: whether to store a single value or a collection of values
  - `:db/doc` (optional but recommended): docstring of the attribute

```clojure
;; attribute 1
{:db/ident :movie/title
 :db/valueType :db.type/string
 :db/cardinality :db.cardinality/one
 :db/doc "The title of the movie"}

;; attribute 2
{:db/ident :movie/genre
 :db/valueType :db.type/string
 :db/cardinality :db.cardinality/one
 :db/doc "The genre of the movie"}

;; attribute 3
{:db/ident :movie/release-year
 :db/valueType :db.type/long
 :db/cardinality :db.cardinality/one
 :db/doc "The year the movie was released in theaters"}
```
