# Concurrency

## Atom

- An `atom` can be modified
- Although they can be modified, they are `thread-safe`
- The value of an atom can be accessed with `@`

### Swap

- The `swap!` function changes the value of an atom
- All other function that modifies an atom must have `!` in its name
- Functions that modify the value of atom are functions with `side effects`

### Retry

- If an atom changes while a function that accesses it is running, this function is `rerun`
- Also before updating an atom (swap), it is checked whether the atom has been changed before. If yes, the whole function is rerun
- The `retry function` must be as simple as possible!
- Therefore, functions that access an atom are performed as a `transaction`
- The retry mechanism is implemented instead of using traditional `locks`

## Reference

- Differs from an atom in a way that it `allows transactions with multiple mutable elements`
- The atom itself do not allow changes from multiple atoms in the same function
- Perform changes with the help of `transactions` with the function `dosync`.
- All operations inside a transaction are performed together, or none of them is performed

## Future

- Returns a `promise` of a result in the future
- Futures are executed in a `parallel thread` and do not block the current thread!
- Futures can `resolve` or `fail`
