# Clojure

- It's a `lisp` (list processor) language
  - Code is made up of lists
  - Every thing in clojure returns a value, therefore lists can be chained
- Clojure
  - Clojure separates data from functionality
  - Clojure visualizes data
  - Clojure code is data
  - Clojure collections are immutable
  - Clojure is data-oriented
- Functional Programming
  - Processes input and produce output
  - No change of state at any way!
  - Data structures are `immutable`, if a change is required, it must be copied with the desired modifications (`copy on modification`)
- Immutable by default
  - Value Semantics
  - Thread Safety
- Null (nil) safety
- `Clojure` is compiled language and runs on `JVM`
- `ClojureScript` is interpreted and runs `Javascript VM`\

```shell
# Installation
pacman -S clojure
pacman -S leiningen
paru "babashka-bin" # clojure interpreter
```

## Form

- A `form` (aka `S-expression` - `sexp`) can be:

  - A symbol
  - A literal
  - Anything enclosed in brackets of some type `()`, `[]`, `{}`, `""`

- **Special form**

  - `Special forms` compose the base minimum of the clojure language
  - They behave very similar to functions

## Functions

- `Arity`: number of parameters that a function receives
- `Higher Order Function`: functions that take functions as arguments
- `Predicate`: functions that return true/false (usually end with ?)
- `Pure Function`
  - Always return the same value for the same input
  - Does not effect anything in its environment (e.g., printing, hitting mutating APIs)

## REPL

- `Read Execute/Evaluate Print Loop`: quickly test scripts
- Connects to the running app
- Modify the app as it is running
- **Jack in**
  - It's the start of REPL along with all the necessary dependencies
  - It has built-in configuration for `Leiningen`, `deps.edn` and `shadow-cljs` projects
  - For projects, it must have a project file in the directory open. E.g., `project.clj` (for leiningen), `deps.edn` (for deps.edn)
  - CLJD REPL types: `Figwheel Main`, `Lein-Figwheel` (legacy figwheel), `shadow-cljs`
- **nREPL protocol**
  - It's used to allow the editor plugin (nREP client) to connect to the Clojure process (nREPL server)
  - It accepts connections and allows the initiation of a program-to-program dialogue
  - It's an asynchronous message-based network protocol for driving interactive development
  - More operations can be supported, or existing operations can be modified or augmented, through `nREPL middleware` (e.g., piggieback)

## Clojure on vscode

- _Calva_ extension

- **REPL**

  - `Ctrl Alt C` + `Ctrl Alt J`: start REPL and connect to REPL (project)
  - `Ctrl Alt C` + `Ctrl Alt C`: connect to REPL (project)

  - `Ctrl Alt O` + `O`: show REPL output window

- **Debug**

  - `Ctrl Alt C` + `I`: instrument a function to be debugged (you must run the function in REPL afterwards)

- **Evaluation**

  - `Ctrl Enter`: evaluate the current form
  - `Alt Enter`: evaluate the current top level form

  - `Ctrl Alt Enter`: evaluate the current enclosing form til cursor
  - `Shift Alt Enter`: evaluate the current top level form til the cursor

  - `Ctrl Alt C` + `Enter`: load current file into REPL
  - `Ctrl Alt C` + `D`: interrupt running evaluations

- **Paredit**

  - `Shift` + `Alt` + `Right/Left`: expand/shrink sexp selection

  - `Ctrl` + `Right/Left/Down/Up`: navigate throughout sexp (forward/backward/down/up)
  - `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `Right/Left/Down/Up`: select throughout sexp (forward/backward/down/up)

  - `Ctrl` + `Alt` + `Backspace`: remove sexp backwards
  - `Ctrl` + `Alt` + `.`: _Slurp Sexp Forwards_ (pull the next Sexp into this Sexp)
  - `Ctrl` + `Alt` + `,`: _Barf Sexp Forwards_ (push the last Sexp out of this Sexp)

  - `Ctrl` + `Alt` + `P` + `R`: replace the enclosing Sexp with the current Sexp

- **Formatting**

  - `Ctrl Alt L`: format the code

- **Testing**
  - `Ctrl Alt C`, `Shift T`: run all tests in the project
  - `Ctrl Alt C`, `T`: run tests for current namespace
  - `Ctrl Alt C`, `Ctrl Alt T`: run current test

## Clojure on intellij

- _Cursive_ plugin

- **Paredit**

  - `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `I`: _Slurp Forward_ (pull the next form into this form)
  - `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `K`: _Barf Forward_ (push the last form out of this form)

- **REPL**

  - `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `R`: run REPL
  - `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `L`: reload REPL
  - `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `P`: run top level form

- **Formatting**
  - `Ctrl` + `Alt` + `L`: format the code
