# Strategy

- Instead of using `Records` (java class) and `Protocols` (java interface) to achieve polymorphism, you can use `defmulti` and `defmethod`
- `defmulti`: create a function that has multiple implementations
- `defmethod`: each implementation to be associated with the multi function
- Dynamic dispatches
- **Strategy**
  - It's the function that defines which implementation must be picked for each case
  - This allows polymorphism not only based on the object type, but also on a custom strategy

```clojure
; function with many implementations
; to strategy must be defined in order to choose which implementation to pick
(defmulti my-fn class) ; use "class" function as strategy

; implementations
(defmethod my-fn
  java.lang.String ; argument that will be passed to the strategy
  [item]
  (println "String:" item))

(defmethod my-fn
  java.lang.Number ; argument that will be passed to the strategy
  [item]
  (println "Number:" item))

;; invoking methods
(my-fn 99)
(my-fn "abc")
```
