## Interpreter

- You can configure your IDE to use a python interpreter (the python binary) with a specific version
  - The python binary can also be picked from your chosen virtual environment
- On vscode, `Python: Select Interpreter`

## Virtual Environment

- Each virtual environment is created based on a python interpreter (version)
- A virtual environment contains all libraries and binaries isolated from the operating system
  - Even the python binary is isolated (although symlinked to the system python binary)
- Options
  - `venv`: the native virtual environment solution
  - `virtualenv`: 3rd party
  - `pipenv`: 3rd party, more recent

```shell
source ./my-awesome-environment/bin/activate
echo $VIRTUAL_ENV
echo $PATH
```

## Language Server

- With homebrew, source files are installed at `/opt/homebrew/Cellar/python@3.12/3.12.1_1/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.12/lib/python3.12`

## Expression vs. Statement

- `Statement`: any unit of code
- `Expression`: special statement that evaluates to some value

```python
# Expression
1 + 2 # evaluates to 3
"a" if 1 != 1 else "b" # evaluates to "a"

# Statement (assignment)
foo = 1 + 2 # doesn't return any value
```
