## Interpreter

- You can configure your IDE to use the python interpreter (the version) as specified by your virtual environment
- On vscode, `Python: Select Interpreter`

## Virtual Environment

- Each virtual environment is created based on a python interpreter (version)
- A virtual environment contains all libraries and binaries isolated from the operating system
  - Even the python binary is isolated (although symlinked to the system python binary)
- Options
  - `venv`: the native virtual environment solution
  - `virtualenv`: 3rd party
  - `pipenv`: 3rd party, more recent

```shell
source ./my-awesome-environment/bin/activate
echo $VIRTUAL_ENV
echo $PATH
```
