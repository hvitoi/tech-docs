# Django Apps

- Apps on Django are features/functionalities in the project
- Apps are defined at `settings.py` in the `INSTALLED_APPS` variables

## Default Apps

- By default the following apps are installed
  - `django.contrib.admin`: admin interface to manage data
  - `django.contrib.auth`: authenticating users
  - `django.contrib.contenttypes`:
  - `django.contrib.sessions`: temporary memory on the server (legacy)
  - `django.contrib.messages`: display one time notifications to the user
  - `django.contrib.staticfiles`: serve static files

## App Modules

- **Views Module** (`views.py`)
  - A view function takes a request and returns a response
  - These are the request handler functions (or action)
- **URLs Module** (`urls.py`)
  - Defines the endpoint path for each event handler
  - This exposes a new API in the server
  - The URLs from any module must be referenced in the main urls.py module
