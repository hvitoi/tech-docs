# Flutter

- A `tool` to build native cross-platform apps (iOS, Android, etc)
- It uses the `react-style` (or `declative-style`) to render the screen
- Flutter is the `SDK` with tools to compile your code to native machine code
- Flutter is the `Framework` (Widget Library) for Dart
  - Has the UI building blocks (widgets), utility functions, packages, etc

paru "flutter"
gpasswd -a "myuser" "flutterusers" # add your username to "flutterusers" group

# brew
brew install --cask "flutter"
```

```shell
# environment variables
export FLUTTER_ROOT=$HOME/flutter
export PATH=$FLUTTER_ROOT/bin:$PATH
```

```shell
flutter precache # precache development binaries
flutter doctor
```

## Android Setup

- **Android Studio Components**
  - `SDK Platform`
    - API 32, API 31, ...
  - `SDK Tools`
    - android-sdk-platform-tools: adb, fastboot
    - android-sdk-cmdline-tools-latest: sdkmanager, avdmanager
    - android-sdk-build-tools: aapt, aidl, dexdump, dx, llvm-rs-cc
    - android-emulator: virtual device

```shell
# pacman
paru "android-studio"

# flatpak
flatpak install "com.google.AndroidStudio"

# brew
brew install "android-studio"
```

- Sdk Path
  - On Mac: `~/Library/Android/sdk`
  - On Linux: `~/Android/Sdk`
  - ... or find it out on android studio preferences

```shell
# environment variables & path https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/variables
export ANDROID_SDK_ROOT=$HOME/Library/Android/sdk
export PATH=$ANDROID_SDK_ROOT/platform-tools:$PATH
export PATH=$ANDROID_SDK_ROOT/cmdline-tools/latest/bin:$PATH
export PATH=$ANDROID_SDK_ROOT/build-tools/33.0.2:$PATH
export PATH=$ANDROID_SDK_ROOT/emulator:$PATH
```

```shell
# Setup android SDK for flutter
flutter config --android-sdk "/path/to/sdk" # optional if the sdk is already in a default path
flutter doctor --android-licenses
flutter doctor
```

- Android Physical Device
  - Enable "USB debugging" under "Developer options"
  - Connect the device and enable "PTP" under "USB Preferences"
  - Allow permanent USB debugging

## iOS Setup

- First install Xcode from `Mac App Store`
- It is installed at `/Applications/Xcode.app`

```shell
# Set default Xcode version (optional - that should be done automatically when installed Xcode)
xcode-select --switch /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
xcodebuild -license accept
xcodebuild -runFirstLaunch

# Simulator: "File > Open Simulator"
open -a Simulator
```

## Other tools

```shell
pacman -S "dart" # optional (it's already bundled with flutter)
pacman -S "android-tools" # optional (adb & fastboot)
paru "google-chrome" # optional (for web applications)
```

## VScode

- "Flutter" and "Dart" extensions
- Ctrl + F5: Start without debugging
- "Flutter: Launch Emulator" to launch android
- Type `st` for snippets for creation of stateless/ful widgets

## Flutter vs. React Native vs. Ionic

- `Flutter`
  - Dart + Flutter
  - Compiled Native Apps
  - Does not compile to (Android/iOS) UI Components (it manually create the elements and control every pixel)
  - Mobile apps, Web app, desktop apps
  - Developed by Google
- `React Native`
  - Javascript/React.js,
  - Partly compiled (UI Components) Native Apps
  - Does compile to (Android/iOS) UI Components (uses the native components of the target platform)
  - Mobile apps or react native web app
  - Developed by Facebook
- `Ionic`
  - Javascript (any or no framework)
  - Webview-hosted web apps
  - Does not compile to (Android/iOS) UI Components, because it's actually a webapp
  - Mobile, web, desktop (with electron)
  - Developed by Ionic
