# Flutter

- A `tool` to build native cross-platform apps (iOS, Android, etc)
- It uses the `react-style` (or `declative-style`) to render the screen
- Flutter is the `SDK` with tools to compile your code to native machine code
- Flutter is the `Framework` (Widget Library) for Dart
  - Has the UI building blocks (widgets), utility functions, packages, etc

## Installation

```shell
# git
git clone "https://github.com/flutter/flutter.git" -b "stable"

# brew
brew install --cask "flutter"
```

paru "google-chrome" # optional (for web applications)
paru "android-studio"
```

## VScode setup

- "Flutter" and "Dart" extensions
- Ctrl + F5: Start without debugging
- "Flutter: Launch Emulator" to launch android
- Type `st` for snippets for creation of stateless/ful widgets

## Project Structure

- `.vscode/`: configuration for vscode
- `android/`: complete native android project
- `build/`: compiled dart code
- `ios/`: complete native ios project
- `lib/`: dart source code (contains the main.dart entrypoint)
- `test/`: automated tests
- `.gitignore`: git ignore
- `.metadata`: metadata of the projeto (managed by flutter)
- `.packages`: packages info (managed by flutter)
- `*.iml`: internal dependencies (managed by flutter)
- `pubspec.lock`: lock package versions from pubspec.yaml
- `pubspec.yaml`: project metadata & depedencies info
- `README.md`: project general information

## Flutter vs. React Native vs. Ionic

- `Flutter`
  - Dart + Flutter
  - Compiled Native Apps
  - Does not compile to (Android/iOS) UI Components (it manually create the elements and control every pixel)
  - Mobile apps, Web app, desktop apps
  - Developed by Google
- `React Native`
  - Javascript/React.js,
  - Partly compiled (UI Components) Native Apps
  - Does compile to (Android/iOS) UI Components (uses the native components of the target platform)
  - Mobile apps or react native web app
  - Developed by Facebook
- `Ionic`
  - Javascript (any or no framework)
  - Webview-hosted web apps
  - Does not compile to (Android/iOS) UI Components, because it's actually a webapp
  - Mobile, web, desktop (with electron)
  - Developed by Ionic
