# State Management

- Allows `state managing` inside of a flutter app using a `store`
- Applies the `Single Source of Truth` principle

## Notifier / Cubit

- It's the class that contain state and manages it
- Upon change, these new values are notified to those who subscribed
- State notification (tell to other widgets that the state has changed)
  - `notifyListeners()` (for ChangeNotifier)
  - `emit()` (for Cubit)

## Provider / BlocProvider

- It's the `store` that monitors the state of a notifier/cubit
- Every `listener` inside the provider is a `singleton` containing all the current values
- Every `listener` is attached to a `notifier` that holds the data to be monitored

## Consumer / BlocBuilder

- Piece of code that will `subscribe` to a value from the store
- The widgets subscribing will automatically build and reload upon changes on the state

## Provider.of / BuildContext.read

- Access the state from the store once
- No subscribing or auto reload
- It can also just invoke a method from the store
