# Widget

- `Widgets` are the building blocks. Similar to components in react.js
- `UI as Code`: build a **widget tree** with a combination of nested widgets
- `Material Design`
  - It's the `Design System` create and heavily used by Google
  - Material Design is built into Flutter (but you can also change to Cupertino - apple design)
- It's a good pratice to keep one widget per file
- Widgets by category: <https://docs.flutter.dev/development/ui/widgets>
- Widgets searchable: <https://api.flutter.dev/>

## StatelessWidget

- `.build()` renders the UI.
- `External data` can be provided by passing value to the widget constructor
- No internal state

## StatefulWidget

- Has an `internal state`
- As soon that the internal state is changed using `setState()` the widget is rerendered automatically
- `setState()` calls `.build()` of the widget again. But flutter is smart enough to update only the nested widgets that have been changed
- Repainting a widget is different from recreating a widget

## Buttons

- `ElevatedButton`
- `TextButton`
- `OutlinedButton`
- `FloatingActionButton`
- `IconButton`

- Deprecated buttons
  - `RaisedButton` -> ElevatedButton
  - `FlatButton` -> TextButton
  - `OutlineButton` -> OutlinedButton
