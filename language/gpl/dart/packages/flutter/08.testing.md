# Testing

- Automated tests
  - `Unit Test`: test a single function
  - `Widget Test`: test a single widget (component)
  - `Integration Test`: test a complete app or a large part of it (e2e)

## WidgetTester

- Offers a way to `navigate through` the app and except several values and behaviors

## Mocks

- A `flaky test` is the test that itself calls external APIs not mocked, and therefore must be avoided because it's unstable
- `Mockito` is a tool used to simulate tasks which depends on external sources

## Directory structure

- `test/`
  - `flows/`: actions that simulate an interaction in the app (e.g., navigation, saving)
  - `matchers/`
  - `mocks/`: generaeted mocks
  - `unit/`: unit tests
  - `widgets/`: widget tests
