# Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

## Abstraction

- Hide the internal working of a given system. The client needs to work only with the interfaces.
- Example: a car exposes the gas and brake pedals, but it doesn't matter to the driver what is happening on the enginer or the brake pads

## Encapsulation

- Data + Functions inside a container (for example, a class)
- The data can be accessed via getters/setters to avoid exposing the information directly

## Inheritance

- Allows reusing classes and avoiding duplicity

## Polymorphism

- Override methods from parent classes
- The returning value must have the same shape
