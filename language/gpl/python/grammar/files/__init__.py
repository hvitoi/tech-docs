# This file signalizes that a folder is actually a package
# Before Python 3.3, you had to have __init__.py in a folder for it to be considered a package.
# Today it’s technically optional for basic importing, but it’s still common practice because:
#   - It signals “this is a package”
#   - You can define what gets imported when you import routers (via __all__)
#   - You can run setup code when the package is imported.

from . import submodule1, submodule2

# this variable specifies what is imported with the "*" syntax
__all__ = ["submodule1", "submodule2"]
