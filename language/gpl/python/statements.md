# Statements

- A `statement` is any unit of code

## Expression

- A special statement that evaluates to some value
- Expressions in python usually can be wrapped in `()`

```python
1 + 2 # evaluates to 3
"a" if 1 != 1 else "b" # evaluates to "a"
```

## Assignment

- Variable assignments

```python
foo = 1 + 2 # doesn't return any value
```
