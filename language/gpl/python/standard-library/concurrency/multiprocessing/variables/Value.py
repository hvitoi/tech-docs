from multiprocessing import Process, Value

# A Value is a shared, single piece of data (int, double, etc.) that multiple processes can safely read and update.
# It uses synchronization under the hood to avoid race conditions.
# ðŸ”¹ When to use: When processes need to share and update one variable.
# Without Value, each process would have its own copy. Here, they share and update the same integer.

        shared_value.value += 1
