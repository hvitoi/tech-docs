# Microservices

- Small `autonomous` service and work together
- `Architectural` design
- Lightweight
- Different languages and storage technologies
- `Independent deployment`
- Cloud enabled: escalate only the necessary part of the whole system

## Challenges

- `Bounded context`
- `Configuration Management`
- `Dynamic Scaling`
- `Visibility`
- `Pack of Cards`

## Microservice Types

- `Data service`: direct access to database
- `Business service`: access to database + business rule
- `Translation service`: calls another service
- `Edge service`: expose the service in a different way for each client
