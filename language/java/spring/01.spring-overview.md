# Java Spring

- Popular framework for building Java applications
- Spring is a `Object Factory`

- Simpler and lightweight alternative to `J2EE` (Java EE)

  - Java EE: Java Platform, Enterprise Edition - Currently version 8 (2017)
  - Multilayer architecture . Corporative applications
  - Earlier versions of `EJB` (Enterprise Java Beans v1 and v2) were extremely complex

- Therefore the `Spring Framework` came along.
  - Book by `Rod Johnson` entitled `Java Development with the Spring Framework`
  - Spring arrived in 2004 (when java EE was in version 4)
  - Currently `Spring version 5`

## Goals of Spring

- Lightweight development with `Java POJOs` (Plain-Old-Java-Objects)
  - As a replacement to EJB
- `Dependency injection` to promote loose coupling
- Declarative programming with `Aspect-Oriented-Programming` (AOP)
- Minimize boilerplate Java code
