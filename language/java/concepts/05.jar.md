# JAR

- `Java Archive`: it's similar to a zip, but with extension .jar
- Stores your compiled code (not the source code)

## META-INF

- The `main` method must be specified on jar creation in order to make it executable
- The `META-INF` folder contains a file called `MANIFEST.MF` which points to the Main-Class (that contains the main method)
