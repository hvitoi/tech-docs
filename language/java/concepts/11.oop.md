# Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

## Abstraction

- Interfaces!

## Encapsulation

- Data + Functions inside a container (the class)

## Inheritance

- Allows reusing classes and avoiding duplicity

## Polymorphism

- Override methods from parent classes
- The returning value must have the same shape
