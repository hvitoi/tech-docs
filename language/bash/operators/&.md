# & (amp)

- Used for job management

```shell
for i in `seq 1 10`; do curl http://site.com &; done
```

- This will print messages from the subscript, but you can replace the `&` with `>/dev/null &` and suppress the output.

## Short cuts

- `Ctrl+z`: puts a job in background
- `Ctrl+c`: stops the currently running job
