# Management

- Jeff Bezos's `S-Team`

## Key Gotchas

### Productivity

- Fewer/no code writing
- Keeping the team productive (focus of amplifying the team's work, not yours)
- Helping on design decisions and architecture
- Listening to your team's decisions
- Not stealing credit

### Lead by example

- team will emulate good and bad behaviors
- Not showing negative thoughts to the team. Working with the upper management

### Time management

- Keeping inbox clean
- Managing your todo list
- Saying no when necessary (tactfully)
  - Are you the right/best person to do it?
  - Explaining what you would need to sacrifice in order to take this task
- Delegating
  - Setting clear expectations on the task
  - Trusting people to do their jobs even for important tasks

## Strategy & Tactics

- Think `strategically`, act `tactically`
- **tactics**: get stuff done. The implementation, the pieces required. The `HOW`
- **strategics**: business objetives to be fulfilled with the task. The `WHY`

## Estimations

- Avoiding overcommitment
- Minding the overhead
  - Other stuff engineers need to do
  - Time for alignments when working in a team
  - Documentation
  - Testing
  - Debugging
  - Studying and researching!
- Listening to your `project manager`
- Involving the team on the estimations

## Dependencies

- Taking a large project and break down into smaller chunks
- Taking in consideration the experience level of each engineer and how quick they can deliver
- Understanding dependencies between tasks (including external dependencies - on other teams)
- Upper management will find odd that you are mentioning the detailed tasks when estimating
  - Because for them it does not matter (strategics only), but for you it does

## Project Management Methodologies

- Kanban
- Scrum
- Waterfall

- Charts
  - `GANTT`
  - `PERT`

## Simplicity

- Prefer simple solutions and evolve it into more complex solution as needed
- Example for recommender system: use a simple graph database instead of deep learning
- Work `backwards` from `customer experience` to the `simplest tool` to achieve the desired goal

## People management

- Have `1:1` meetings once a week with everyone in the team
  - Talk about carer goals
  - Blockers. Understand issues and personal sides for low performance
  - Give feedbacks (positive and negative)
  - Receive feedback
  - Give recognition! Acknowledge work well done
  - Agenda
    - Check-in on project status (and blockers)
    - Check-in on performance goals
    - Check-in on career goals
    - Feedback (positive and negative)
    - Feedback for you
- Sandwich feedback
  - Start with good feedback
  - Tell the negative feedback
  - And end with positive feedback
- **SMART** goals
  - `S`pecific
  - `M`easurable
  - `A`chievable
  - `R`elevant
  - `T`ime based
- Checkpoints
  - Check periodically if the engineer is receiving opportunities to achieve the goals
  - Is the engineer on track to achieve it?

## Handling emotions

- `Reflective listening` & `Active listening`
- You don't need to come up with a solution instantly
  - People just want to be heard and to validate what they are feeling is valid
- Repeat with your own words that they said to confirm that you understood correctly
- Don't make judgments!
- Don't try to fix it yourself, share with HR if it's a delicate problem
- Write down the situation and keep it in a safe place

## Hiring

- Sourcing
  - Interns / college hires
  - Incent employee referrals
  - Open source projects contributors
  - Academic papers
  - Social media
  - Technical events / tech talks / hackathons
  - Internal hires
  - Remote workers

## Firing

- Don't do it out of anger
- Don't deflect blame
- Don't make it personal
- Don't give false hope
- Employee has to know for some time that he is not meeting expectations
- You should offer a performance improvement plan first
- Be transparent the whole cycle so that the person can even look for a new job first
- On layoffs:
  - Make sure final payments / severance are available
  - Guidance for unemployment & insurance

## Working with upper management

- Honesty
- A good relationship will make both more effective
- Have backbone, disagree and commit
  - It's okay to push back something that you are told to do
  - No one better than you that understands the limitations of your team
- Sometimes you need to accept/commit a decision even though you don't agree
  - The upper management may be right about it, you just didn't consider all the variables
- When something wrong happens
  - Be honest
  - Come with solutions
  - Present the plan to fix the immediate problem
  - Show that you understand the root cause (5 WHYs)
  - Preferably come with the actions taken
- Meetings etiquette
  - If you don't know say `I don't know` but find out and follow up
  - Don't interrupt others

## Team morale

- People instinctively identify themselves as part of a group/tribe, build your tribe.
- Set a common goal
- Care about each individual's goals too
- If a project needs to be aborted, communicate with your team accordingly and recognize the great work done so far
- Brainstorm ideas for making your team more cohesive based on what you've learned
