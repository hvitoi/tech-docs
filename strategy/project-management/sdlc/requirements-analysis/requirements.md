# Requirements

- `Requirements` is a formal description of how the system should behave
- It's important to raise the right requirements because changes in large systems are expensive (engineers, contracts, reputation, brand)
- Requirements are the `architectural drivers`

## Gathering requirements

- The client (who demands the feature) usually do not know what they need (the requirement), but they know `what they want to solve`
  - Allow people to join drivers on a route, who are willing to take passengers for a fee
  - A system that allows sharing of large files between users.
- What problem is being solved here?

- `Make the right questions` to solve the problem!
