## Agile Manifesto Values

- Agile is a mindset

![Agile Mindset](./images/agile-mindset.png)

- There are `4 values` for the agile mindset

1. **Individuals and interaction** over processes and tools
1. **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
1. **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
1. **Responding to change** over following a plan

- These values are further described into `12 principles`

## Agile Methodology

- `Iterative` approach to software development
- `Small cycles` referred as `sprints` or `iterations`
- With every iteration new features are added to the product
- Small, self-organizing teams of `software developers` and `business representatives`

## Agile at Scale

- `Vertical Scaling`: integrate the work of multiple teams into a single product
- `Horizontal Scaling`: apply agile mindset at other departments (hr, sales, finance, etc)

- `SAFe` (Scaled Agile Framework) is a popular scaling method

## Agile Tools

### KPI

- Assessment

### Scrum

- Built on
  - Transparency
  - Inspect
  - Adaption
  - Short learning cycles
- Flow
  - Iteration planning
  - DSU: daily stand up

### Kanban

- Board with `todos`
- `Classes of service` (CoS): level of urgency of the items
  - Expedite: critical priority
  - Fixed Date: high cost of delay
  - Standard: moderate cost of delay
  - Intangible: no cost of delay

### Extreme Programming

- Test-driven Development
- Collective Ownership
- Coding standards
- Automated testing
- Pair work
- Simple Design
- Refactoring
- Continuous Integration
- User Stories

### V-Model

- Write feature
- Write Story
- Write Code
- Test-Code
