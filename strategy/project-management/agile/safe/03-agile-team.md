# Agile team

- A team consist of `5 - 11 members`
- Each team choose the agile framework that best fits it. E.g., Scrum, XP, Kankan, ...
- This team `defines`, `build`, `test` and `deliver` an increment of `value` in a short timebox (`iteration`)
- Shared responsability - feeling of ownership

## Events

### Development Iteration

- Timebox during which a team deliver incremental value (tested working software)
- `2 to 4 weeks`
- Based on `Plan`, `Do`, `Check`, `Adjust` (PDCA)
- All teams in ART have common iteration start/end dates

- **Events**

  - `Iteration Planning`:
    - PO defines iteration goals
    - AT defines how and how much (capacity) - initial velocity (availability, acknowledging time off and other potential duties)
    - Detail the stories
    - Focus on small batch sizes
    - Max 4 hours
  - `Iteration Execution`: Work, work
  - `Iteration Review`: Review the previous increment results. 1-2 hours
  - `Iteration Retrospective`: identify ways to improve. 30-60min. Quantitative + Qualitative parts
  - `Backlog Refinement`: Estimate items in the backlog and set acceptance critiria. Takes place once or twice in the iteration
  - `Daily standup` (DSU): quick daily followup. Meet after if necessary

### Innovation & Planning Iteration

- Occurs after every PI
- Dedicated time for innovation, training (education), planning and other events

- `Innovation`: hackathons, infrastructure improvements
- `Planning`: Cadence-based planning

- Estimating `guardband` for cadence-based delivery

## Building an Agile Team

- Team Development Stages

  1. `Forming`: members getting to known
  1. `Storming`: stress and hostility
  1. `Norming`: forming a family
  1. `Performing`: trust atmosphere
  1. `Adjourning`: conquer together

## Team Culture

- **CALMR**

  - `Culture`: shared responsability, ownership
  - `Automation`: CI/CD pipelines
  - `Lean flow`: small batch sizes
  - `Measurement`: flow through the pipeline
  - `Recovery`: test, recovery

## Team Types

- `Stream-aligned team`: deliver value directly to the end user
  - By product, solution, service
  - By customer
  - By solution feature
- `Complicated subsystem team`: deep specialty skills and expertise
  - Set of services
- `Platform team`: support of a platform that providers services for other teams
  - Safe critical systems
  - Algorithms
- `Enabling team`: assist other teams to become proficient in new technologies
  - DevOps implementation
  - Automated testing
  - Engineering quality
  - Security environment
- **Feature Team**
  - Cross-functional and long-lived
  - Pick features from product backlog and completes them
- **Component Team**
  - Develops one or more components
  - The components are used to develop a part of the feature
  - Components can be reused

## Agile Team Charter

- `Purpose`: contribution of the team
- `Type & Responsabilities`: Responsability on the ART
- `Working Agreements`: do not delay, daily meetings
- `Success Measures`: stories delivered
- `Definition of Done`: criteria that work must meet
- `Key Interactions`: interfaces, stakeholders
- `Key Stakeholders`:

## Definition of Done

- `Team increment`: test pass, in git
- `System increment`
- `Solution increment`
- `Release'`
