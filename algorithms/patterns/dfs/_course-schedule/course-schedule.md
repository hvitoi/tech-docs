# Course Schedule

> [LeetCode #207](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule/) — Medium

There are a total of `numCourses` courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `numCourses - 1`. You are given an array `prerequisites` where `prerequisites[i] = [a_i, b_i]` indicates that you **must** take course `b_i` first if you want to take course `a_i`.

For example, the pair `[0, 1]` indicates that to take course `0` you have to first take course `1`.

Return `true` if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return `false`.

## Examples

### Example 1

```text
Input:  numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1, 0]]
Output: true
Explanation: There are 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input:  numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1, 0], [0, 1]]
Output: false
Explanation: There are 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0,
             and to take course 0 you should have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= numCourses <= 2000`
- `0 <= prerequisites.length <= 5000`
- `prerequisites[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= a_i, b_i < numCourses`
- All the pairs `prerequisites[i]` are **unique**.

## What to practise

This is a **directed-graph cycle detection** problem (equivalently: does a topological sort exist?).

Two standard approaches — practise both:

- **DFS with three colours** (white/grey/black): visit a node grey while exploring; if you hit a grey neighbour, there's a cycle.
- **Kahn's algorithm (BFS)**: compute indegrees, repeatedly pop indegree-0 nodes; if you pop fewer than `numCourses`, there's a cycle.
