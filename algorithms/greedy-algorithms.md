# Greedy Algorithms

> An algorithmic paradigm that follows the problem solving approach of making the locally optimal choice at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum.

This may not apply to all cases!

## Example

- Given a monetary amount (35 dollars) find the minimum number of bills necessary to pay someone this amount having a $20, $10, $5 and $1 bills

A solution would not be found if there are no $1 bills
