# Cyclic models

- Continuous improvement by cyclic iterations
- No problem is defined completely in the first try
- Therefore multiple cycles are necessary
- Deals how to tackle unknown problems

- `Reference` for cyclic models
  - Toyota from 80s
  - General Electric from 90s
  - Apple from 2000s

## Kaizen (Lean)

- Lean processes in `Toyota`

## PDCA (Deming)

- `Plan, Define, Check, Act`
- Aka Deming circle/cycle/wheel
- It was defined by the Kaizen methodology

## DMAIC (6 Sigma)

- `Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve and Control` (DMAIC)
- For `6 Sigma` world
- Do not mistake on the same thing more than once!
- Control item

## Sprint (Scrum)

- For software development!
- A little bit of chaos is added at each sprint
- Then it's organized during the sprint

## MVP (Lean Startup)

- `Minimal viable product`
  - And improve it with time
- A prototype!
- Define the time and the cost first!
  - And then fit a product into this constraints

## Try & Error

- Also a cyclic model!
