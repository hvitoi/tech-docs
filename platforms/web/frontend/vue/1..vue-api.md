# Vue API

- Vue API uses the declarative programming approach
- It uses `data` (initial state), `methods` (change state), and `computed` (show state)

```js
new Vue({
  el: '#app'
  data: {
    textInput: ''
  }
  methods: {
    onInput: function (event) {
      this.textInput = event.target.value; /* this refers to the state object */
    }
  }
  computed: {
    identicon: function() {
      return jdenticon.toSvc(this.textInput, 200);
    }
  }
});
```

## Declarative Programming

- In a `declarative programming`, a `initial state` and a set of `rules` are used to accomplish a goal
- The `imperative programming` in contrast is just a set of instructions to be followed in order
