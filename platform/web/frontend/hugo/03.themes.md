# Themes

- **themes/**
- This is where the 3rd party theme code is placed
- Installing themes varies from theme to theme, the most common setup involves cloning it into the `themes/<theme>` directory as a submodule

```shell
mkdir themes
git submodule add https://github.com/devcows/hugo-universal-theme
```

```toml
# reference to the exact folder name
theme = 'hugo-universal-theme'
```
