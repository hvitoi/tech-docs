# Tokens

## Surrogate token

- Surrogate tokens are used in operations that require access to customer data.
- Surrogate tokens differ from regular tokens in that they try to be more specific, giving access to what the agent needs to work a given job.
- Contain ACLâ€™s and principal ids
- ACL contains list of URLs that the token can be used for
- Surrogate tokens are generated for each job taken by an agent
