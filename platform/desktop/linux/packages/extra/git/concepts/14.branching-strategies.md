# Branching Strategies

1. `Trunk Based`
   - Single branch (mainline)
   - High team maturity
   - Feature toggles (feature flags)
   - Continuous Deployment
1. `Feature Branching`
   - One branch per feature
   - Short delivery
   - Continuous Delivery
   - Pull Requests to merge to mainline
1. `Forking Strategy`
   - Fork whole repository
   - Open-source projects
   - Do not deal with permissions
1. `Release Branching`
   - One branch per release
   - Low frequency deployments
   - Waterfall
   - No continuos integration
   - Support for previous releases (backwards compatibility)
   - No automation
1. `Git flow`
   - Many branches (mainline, development, releases, features)
   - Long lived branches
   - Complex and not recommended
1. `Github flow`
   - PR flow
   - Short-lived branches merged via PRs
1. `Environment branching`
   - Environment branches on top of all others
   - Worst approach

## Good practices

- No long-lived branches
