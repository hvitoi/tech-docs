## What is DevOps

- Union of `people`, `process` and `products`
- `OODA Cycle`: observe–orient–decide–act
- Aim to make delivery cycle shorter!
- `Greenfield` vs. `Brownfield` projects
  - Greenfield (new) projects are easier to move to devops
  - Brownfield (existing) projects are more complex for devops to be implemented

## Metrics and KPIs

- `Faster outcomes`: deployment frequency, speed, size and lead time
- `Efficiency`

## Agile development

- `Waterfall approach`
  - Older methodology
  - Longer development cycle.
  - Difficult to receive feedbacks from the client
- `Agile approach`
  - Quick response and shorter development cycle.
  - Based on `releases` and `interactions`
  - Horizontal teams: `squads`
