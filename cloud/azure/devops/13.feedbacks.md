# Optimize Feedback Mechanisms

- **Site Reliability Engineering** (`SRE`)

  - Empower software developers to own the ongoing daily operation of their applications in production
  - Software developers now control their own apps!
  - Lower the workload of the operations team!
  - This professional must have `deep knowledge about the app`, it's business rules and configuration
  - Tasks: Monitor, performance, business logic

- `SRE` has a global view about the software delivery

## SRE vs. DevOps

- `SRE` is a person, and he takes the problems and solves it himself
- `DevOps` is an organization, it protects the production environment with automated tasks

## Application Insights

- Service for monitoring and alerting
