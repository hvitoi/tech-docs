# Infrastructure as Code

- `Manual deployment`

  - Snowflake servers
  - Deployment steps vary by environment
  - More verification steps
  - Slower release cadence to minimize pain and long weekends

- `Infrastructure as code`

  - Consistent servers between environment
  - Fully automate creation and updates of environments
  - Use blue/green deployments
  - Treat servers as cattle, not pets

- Azure Resource Manager (`ARM`) is a form of IaC

## Modularization

- Divide automation assets into logical parts

## Imperative vs. Declarative

- `Declarative`

  - Functional
  - Defines what the final state should be

- `Imperative`
  - Procedural
  - Defines the "how" for what the final state should be

## Idempotence

- `Idempotence`: Ability to apply one or more operations against a resource, resulting in the same outcome!
  - E.g., if a pod already exists, it will not be reapplied on kubectl apply with the same yaml

## Chef

- `Chef` is an infrastructure automation tool that is used to manager apps and infra
- Components
  - Chef Server
  - Chef Client (node)
  - Chef Workstation: Developer machine
  - Cookbooks: File with all the tasks (recipes)
  - Recipes: Tasks
- `Chefknife`: command to run the configs

## Puppet

- Deployment and configuratio management toolset
- Client server model
- Components

  - Pippet Master
  - Puppet Agent: Machines managed bby the server
  - Console Services: Web interface
  - Facts: Metadata related to state

- `Manifest files`: extensive .pp

## Ansible

- Open-source platform that automates cloud provisioning configuration management
- It's agentless, no software needs to be configured in the machines
- Ansible uses the own resources of the server (E.g., ssh, win)
- Ansible is based on python and it's easy to earn! Uses YAML
- Ansible uses `playbooks` which contain the list of instructions

## Terraform

- Allows you to provision, manage and version `cloud infrastructure`
- Terraform`s CLI provides simple mechanism to deploy to Azure, AWS, Google, etc
- `Componentes`
  - Configuration files `.tf`
  - Terraform CLI
  - Modules
