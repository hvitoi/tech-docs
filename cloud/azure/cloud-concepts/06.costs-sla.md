# Cost Management and Service Level Agreements

## Planning and Managing costs

- **Factors that affect costs**

  - REsource types
  - Services
  - Locations
  - Ingress and egress traffic

- **Minimize costs**

  - Azure Advisor (cost tab)
  - Auto shutdown dev/qa resources
  - Utilize cool/archive storage where possible
  - `Reserved instances` (Hybrid Benefit)
  - Alerts when billing exceeds an expected level
  - Policies to restrict access to certain expensive resources (E.g., cannot run a VM with more than 16 cpus)
  - `Auto scaling` resources (shrink as required)
  - Downsize when resources over-provisioned
  - Ensure every resource has an owner (tags). (Whose is this resource?)
  - `Azure Cost management`: analyze spending
  - `Azure Functions`: 1 million executions free per month. $0.20 per million executions. Cheapest VM is $20 per month
  - Microsoft has economy of scale to give you the cheaper price
  - `Spot pricing`: Ability to use a VM when nobody is using it for a discounted price. When someone needs to use it, you get kicked off

- **Consumption model**

- `Pay per usage`: Functions
- `Pay per time`: VMs
- `pay for bandwith`: Pay for outbound data (inbound is free)

## Pricing calculator

- Configurable options: `Region`, `Tier`, `Subscription Type`, `Support Options`, `Dev/Test`

- **Total cost of ownership** (TCO)

  - The total cost of a resource
  - Includes: electricity, cooling, internet, rack space, setup labor, maintenance, backup, etc

## Service Level Agreement (SLA)

- Microsoft makes a promise about the service quality they offer
- VM: `99,99%` for multiple Availability Zones, `99,95%` for same Availability Set, `99,90%` for single instance
- For composite SLA, simply multiply the SLAs
- Add `redundancy` to increase the SLA

## Preview features

- `Public preview`: for everyone
- `Private Preview`: Have to signup for it
- `General Availability`: When a preview becomes official
