# Identity, governance, privacy and compliance

## Identity services

- **Authentication**: User priving who they are (user ID and password)
- **Authorization**: Ensuring that s user is permitted to perform an action

- `Azure Active Directory` (AD)
  - IDentity as a Service (IDaaS)
  - Authentication mechanism
  - Supports synchronizing with organizational AD
- `Single-Sign On` (SSO): Same user id and password for multiple applications
- `LDAP`: Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
- `Multi-Factor Authentication` (MFA): Third factor is a phone sms, application confirm, etc
- `Conditional Access`: Block suspicious access

## Governance

- **Role-Based Access Control** (RBAC)

  - It's an authorization mechanism
  - Create `roles` that represent the common tasks of the job
  - Granular permissions to the roles
  - Assign users to roles
  - `Built-in roles`: _Reader_, _Contributor_, _Owner_

- **Locks**

  - `Read only` lock
  - `Can not delete` lock
  - Access to locked resources can be restricted with RBAC

- **Policies**

  - `Policies` are restrictions imposed to services
    - Examples of `built-in policies`: require SQL 12+, allowed locations, allows SKUs, require tags
  - A set of policies grouped together are `policy initiatives`
    - E.g., every resource and resource group must have these five tags

- **Blueprints**

  - Create subscription template with `roles` and `policies` already defined

- **Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure**

  - Set of documentation, guidance, tools to migrate to the cloud
  - Define Strategy, PLan, Ready, Adopt, Govern, Manage

## Privacy and Compliance

- `Compliance` is a general term that means the `standards` and `rules` (outside of the company or internal) that you need to follow:

  - `General Data Protection Regulation` (GDPR): Give EU citizens data protection. Affect companies outside of the EU that handle EU citizen's data
  - `Internation Organization Standardization` (ISO): standards about quality assurance
  - `NIST Cybersecurity Framework` (CSF)

- `Compliance Manager`: Workflow-based risk assessment tool to help you manage regulatory compliance
- `Trusted Cloud`: Security, Privacy, Compliance, Resiliency, Intellectual Property Protection
- `Online Service Terms`: Terms and conditions for use
- `Data Protection Addendum` (DPA): How MS handle personal data.
