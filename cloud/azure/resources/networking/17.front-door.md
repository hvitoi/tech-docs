# Azure Front Door

- Routing service that routes traffic based on the performance of your endpoints
- It's like an `API gateway` and works as a load balancer
- Routes the client requests to the fastest and most available backend
- Works at `Layer 7` (HTTP/HTTPS)

- **URL-based routing**: route traffic based on the URL path
  - E.g., /images goes to backend-1 /videos goes to backend-2
- **Multi-site hosting**: more than one website on the same Front Door configuration
- **Session affinity**: keep a user session attached to the same application backend
- **SSL termination**: ssl connections can be terminated at the front door itself instead of being processed by the backend servers
- **Web Application Firewall**: protect your web application from internet based attacks

## Configuration

- **Front-end domain**

  - E.g., <https://hvitoi.azurefd.net>
  - `Session affinity` and `firewall` can be setup too

- **Backend pool**

  - Services that can be hosted on a VM, webapps, storage, etc
  - `Weightage`: proportion of requests that will be redirected to which backend. E.g., 50% 50%
  - `Priority`: which backend takes priority over another. E.g, 1, 2
  - `Health probes`: path to check health of the API

- **Routing rule**

  - `Patterns to Match`: paths to redirect to the backend pool. E.g, `/*` (all)
  - `Route details`: Forward or redirect
  - `Forwarding protocol`: HTTP, HTTPS or match request
  - `URL rewriting`
  - `Cache`

## Compression

- Files need to be under 8 MB
- File formart `MIME` (xml) and others are supported
- Compression type `Brotli` and others are supported
