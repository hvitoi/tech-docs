# Network Security Group

- Control the flow of traffic into and out of the VM
- The Network Security Group is `attached to the NIC` or the `attached to the entire subnet`
  - NSG associated with the subnet are evaluated first!
- `Inbound Security Rules`: flow into the VM
- `Outbound Security Rules`: flow out of the VM
- The `NSG` can be completely detached from the NIC. This way the NIC will be completely open

## Security rules

- Rule specification

  - `Priority`: Priority of the rule to be applied
  - `Port`: specific port or port ranges (50-100)
  - `Protocol`: protocol to allow/deny
  - `Source and Destination`: IP or CIDR range

- **Default Inbound rules**

  - `AllowVnetInBound`: Any VM can communication with other VM within the same network
  - `AllowAzureLoadBalancerInBound`: VMs can communicate with the LB
  - `DenyAllInBound`: Deny all other inbound traffic

- **Default Outbound rules**

  - `AllowVnetOutBound`: Allow all traffic within a network
  - `AllowInternetOutBound`: Allow traffic to the internet
  - `DenyAllOutBound`: All other traffic is denied

- When specifying a destination IP rule, the `private ip` must be used. Azure translates it to public IP

## NSG for subnets

- The rules for NSG attached to the subnet apply first!
- A NSG can be associated to a subnet under the `Subnets tab`

## ICMP Traffic

- A `ping` request is based on the `ICMP protocol`, therefore it must be allowed as inbound rule
