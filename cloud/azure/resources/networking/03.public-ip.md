# Public IP address

- The assignment of public IP can be configured as `Dynamic` or `Static`
- When the VM is deallocated, the publish ip is lost.
  - To ensure the public ip does not change, a `static ip` must be set
- The public ip can be `disabled` on the network interface config
  - When deleting the public id address you are deleting the public IP address resource
- The public IP address is `attached to the NIC`, while the private IP is assgined by the subnet rules

## SKUs

- `Basic`: Do not allow a VM running without NSG
- `Standard`: Allow a VM without NSG (you know what you are doing)
