# Network Watcher

- Provide tools to `monitor`, `diagnose`, `view metrics` and enable or disable logs for resources in Azure VNet
- It's used to `monitor the network` of your `IaaS`
- Network Watcher requires a `Network Watcher Agent`

## Tools

- `IP flow verify`: Detect traffic filtering problems. Check if a VM has connectivity on port X. Check connectivity issues based on NSG attached to the NIC.
- `Next Hop`: Detecting VM routing problems. Use to check if traffic is flowing to the desired destination
- `Package Capture`: Capture traffic from/to VM
- `NSG Flow Logs`: Info about ingress/egress onto the NSG. Operate at Layer 4. The logs are stored in a storage account. **Traffic analytics** can be enabled for graphs from the NSG logs
- `Traffic Analysis`: User and application activity
- `Connection troubleshoot`: Diagnose connectivity. Differently from IP flow verify, it checks check there is a service listening to the request
- `Connection Monitor`: Network performance, connectivity checks (HTTP, TCP, ICMP)
- `VPN troubleshoot`: Connectivity between onprem and azure resources
