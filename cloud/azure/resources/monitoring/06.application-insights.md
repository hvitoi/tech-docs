# Application insights

- `Application Performance` management for web developers
- Helps `detecting anomalies` in the application
- Must be created in the same region of the VM to monitor
- The actual metrics data is stored in a separate resource called `Log Analytics Workspace`

- **Monitoring**

  - Request rates
  - Response times
  - Failure rates
  - User and session counts

- **Understand how users use the app**

  - `Users & Session`: see currently logged users
  - `Funnels`: see how users are progressing through the stages of the page. E.g, from index.html (top step) onto details.html (second step)
  - `User Flows`: visualize how users navigate between pages (what is clicked, if user navigates away, repeated actions)
  - `Retention`: if users return to the app
  - `Impact`: if a module (a page) of the app is impacting the experience of the user

## Instrumentation package

- Application insights works `installing a instrumentation package` within the application to be monitored

- Ways of installing the instrumentation package

  - **Embedded into the code itself**
    - The `Connection string` of the Application insights must be inserted into the code or the resource to be monitored
    - Connection string can be found in `Properties tab` in Application Insights resource
  - **Added on top of the resource containing the application** (VM or WebApp)
    - It's enable under the `Monitoring` tab on webapp creation
    - Afterwards, under Application Insights tab it must be enabled

## Live Metrics

- Show info about all resources monitored by Application Insights with live metrics
- If you want to see `errors` that can occur in Azure Functions `locally`
- You can use Live metrics stream to see the requests and any exceptions which occur

## Application Map

- Draws a map of the different components of the system
  - Similar to Kiali

## Availability

- Constantly perform `availability tests` on the application
- `URL ping test` every 5 min from different locations
- Checks also the response time with clients from multiple locations (`Multi-step web`)

## Usage and estimated costs

- Under Configure/`Usage and estimated costs`
- Under `Data retention` you can decide for how long you want to retain the data collected by Application Insights
- If you have massive amounts of data being generated , it might slow down your application. In such cases, you can send `data samples` instead onto Application Insights
- You can also set a `Daily cap` on what is the maximum amount of data that can be collected by Application Insights on a daily basis
  - With daily cap you can prevent high costs with monitoring

## Application Insights Sdk

- Telemetry data available locally

```cs
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
  services.AddControllersWithViews();
  services.AddApplicationInsightsTelemetry(); // Telemetry SDK
  services.AddSingleton<ITelemetryInitializer, MyTelemetry>();
}

```

```cs
public class MyTelemetry : ITelemetryInitializer
{
  private IHttpContextAccessor _context;
  public MyTelemetry(IHttpContextAccessor httpContextAccessor)
  {
    _context = httpContextAccessor ?? throw new ArgumentNullException("httpContextAccessor");
  }
  public void Initialize(ITelemetry telemetry)
  {
    var current = _context.HttpContext;
    if (current != null)
    {
      if (current.Request.Headers.ContainsKey("UserId"))
      {
        telemetry.Context.User.Id = current.Request.Headers["UserId"].ToString();
        telemetry.Context.Session.Id = telemetry.Context.User.Id;
        telemetry.Context.User.AuthenticatedUserId = telemetry.Context.User.Id;
      }
      else
        telemetry.Context.User.Id = "1";
    }
  }
}
```

## SQL Dependency

- Tracks the SQL commands that the application issued
- Must be enabled under `Application Insights` tab in the web app resource
