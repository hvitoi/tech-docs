# Service Bus

- It can work in two different ways:
  - `Sender` -> **Queue** -> `Receiver` (Basic, Standard, Premium)
  - `Publisher` -> **Topic** -> `Subscribers` (Standard, Premium)
- The service bus receives a namespace name
  - E.g., <hvitoi.servicebus.windows.net>

## Connection strings

- For queues and topics: `Shared access policies` (RootManageSharedAccessKey)
- For one queue only: `Queues`/`Shared access policies` -> Add
- For one topic only: `Topics`/`Shared access policies` -> Add

## Good practices

- **Client**

  - Service Bus Client connection are defined as the type `IQueueClient`
    - In the background these clients make use of `MessagingFactory` object
  - Do not close connection directly after sending or receiving message
    - The connection operation is an expensive operation
    - Use the same client for multiple operations!

- **Client batching**

  - Delays the send of message and then many at once as a batch
  - Increases the throughput
  - Do not use batching if you need low latency

- **Batched store access**

  - The queue itself batches multiple messages before writing to the internal store

- **Enable Prefetch**

  - Receiver quietly more messages than it's told to and buffer it for latter use
  - Reduces the latency
  - Defined in `QueueClient.PrefetchCount` and `SubscriptionClient.PrefetchCount`
  - Does not work well with `ReceiveAndDelete`, because the app can crash and the messages will be lost
