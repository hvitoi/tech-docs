# Disk

- `OS Disk`
  - Managed disk
    - Designed for high availability (99.999%)
- `Temporary Disk`
  - Size varies on the instance size
  - Data on temporary disk is lost during a maintenance event or on redeploy
- `Additional disks`
  - Can be added as needed

## Managed Disk

- Managed disks are designed to store the OS files. It provides high availability

## Disk SKU

- `IOPS`: Input/output operations per second (read and writes to data). For DBs it must be high
- `Throughput`: Amount of data being set to the storage disk. Must be high for video download

- `Ultra disk`: 2 GiB/s
- `Premium SSD`: 900 MiB/s
- `Standard SSD`: 750 MiB/s
- `Standard HDD`: 500 MiB/s

## Disk Encryption

- **Server Side Encryption (SSE)**` with PMK encryption

  - `Encryption at-rest with a platform-managed key` (default)
  - `Encryption at-rest with a customer-managed key`
    - The encryption key can be generated and stored at the key vault
  - `Double encryption with platform-managed and customer-managed keys`

- You can't change the encryption type unless you stop the VM

- **Azure Disk Encryption**
  - Encryption at the OS level
    - For Windows: `Bitlocker`
    - For Linux: `LUKS`
  - `Disk` -> `Additional Settings`
  - A key can be selected from the key vault
    - Under access policies, `Azure Disk Encryption for volume` must be enabled
  - No disk encryption set is required!

### Disk Encryption Sets

- Links a `key` onto the `disk encryption set` to encrypt a disk with `customer-managed key`
- The **disk encryption sets** communicates with the key vault (A service principal is added to the key vault access policies)

- After created, a `disk`, `image` or `snapshot` can be associated with the `disk encryption set`
  - Under `encryption tab` in the VM resource
  - The VM must be deallocated in order to configure the encryption

## Disk Snapshots

- A `snapshot` from a `disk` can be created from the disk instance
- A snapshot is a `resource`
- A new disk can be created from a snapshot
- The `new disk` can be then attached to another VM

## Shared disks

- `Shared disks`: Allow a `managed disk` to be attached to multiple VMs
- Only allows for `ultra` and `premium` disks with at least 256gb
