# Proximity Placement Group

- Proximity placement groups allow you to group Azure `resources physically closer together` in the same region.
- Proximity placement groups `improve the overall application performance` by reducing the network latency among virtual machines.

- The `VM` is assigned to a `Proximity Placement Group` upon creation on `Advanced tab`
