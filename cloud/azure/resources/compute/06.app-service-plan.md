# App Service Plan

- It's a machine where the web apps will run
- One `app service plan` can have multiple `web apps`
- One `app service plan` can run `multiple runtime stack`, but only `one OS`
- One `app service plan` can run apps from the `same region` only

- SKU and sizes

  - `Free (F)`: 1 GB disk. 10 apps. 60 min / day
  - `Shared (D)`: 1 GB disk. 100 apps. 240 min /day
  - `Basic (B)`: 10 GB. Up to 3 instances
  - `Standard (S)`: 50 GB. Up to 10 instances. Autoscale
  - `Premium (P)`: 250 GB. Up to 30 instances. Autoscale
  - `Isolated`: 1 TB. Up to 100 instances. Autoscale
  - `App Service Linux`

- You are billed based on the consumpting of the app service plan, not the web app itself

## App Service Environment (ASEs)

- When your app is assigned exclusively to a single `service plan`
- Useful for huge applications (E.g., e-commerce portal)

## Autoscaling

- Requires the `standard` app service plan
- For inferior app service plans, only manual scaling is allowed

- `Scale out`: increase number of instances
- `Scale in`: decrease number of instances
- `Scale up`: increate size of instances
- `Scale down`: decrease size of instances

- **Conditions**
  - Based on metrics of the app service plan
    - CPU percentage
    - Memory percentage
  - Based on metrics of other azure resources
- `Cool down period`: time after a scale rule has been triggered in which no actions can be triggered again
- `Maximum and minimum instances`: to avoid DDoS attacks
