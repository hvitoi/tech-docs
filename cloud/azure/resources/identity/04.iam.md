# IAM (Identity Access Manager)

- `IAM tab` is used to give permission to `entities`
- Roles can be assigned at one of the following layers
  - `Resource`
  - `Resource group`
  - `Subscription`
  - `Management group`

## Role Assignments

- It's an `authorization` system built on top of `ARM`
- By default, the `admin user` has `User Access Administrator` inherited role to all resources
- `Add role assignment` to grant accesses to this resource
- Assign access to

  - A `user`
  - A `group`
  - A `service principal`

- A role assignment to a VM does no imply access to all other related resources (NIC, NSG, Public IP, Disk, etc)
- Alternatively you can give access at the resource group where the VM lives. This way, all resources within the RG `inherits` the role.

### Built-in roles

- <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/rbac-and-directory-admin-roles>

- `Owner`: unrestricted permissions, including managing accesses
- `Contributor`: unrestricted permissions, expect managing accesses
- `Reader`: view all resources, but no change permissions
- `User Access Administrator`: manage user access to Azure resources
- ...

### Custom roles

- A role definition must be created

```json
{
  "Name": "stagingrole",
  "Id": null,
  "IsCustom": true,
  "Description": "Allows for read access to Azure Virtual Machines and storage accounts",
  "Actions": ["Microsoft.Compute/*/read", "Microsoft.Storage/*/read"],
  "NotActions": [],
  "AssignableScopes": ["/subscriptions/20c6eec9-2d80-4700-b0f6-4fde579a8783"]
}
```

## Options for accessing a resource

1. **Access keys**: authentication via a connection string. Least preferred option
1. **AD RBAC**: authenticate and authorize an `Application Object` against Azure AD with an `access token`. The Roles are defined under IAM tab
