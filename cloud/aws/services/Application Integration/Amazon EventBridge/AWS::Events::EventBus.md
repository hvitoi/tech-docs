# AWS::Events::EventBus

- Events are sent to the **buses**
  - `Default bus`: events generated by AWS services
  - `Partner event bus`: events generated by 3rd party applications (E.g., datadog, zendesk, etc)
  - `Custom event bus`: events generated by your own applications

## Schema Registry

- Analyze the events in the bus and `infer` its `schema`
- `Schema Registry` generates code for the application so that it knows how to structure the event before sending
- Schemas can be versioned
