# Sign In

Sign in to AWS account can be done by `user type`

- **Root user**: account owner & unrestricted access
  - Shows only the account ID

- **IAM user**: user within an account & restricted access
  - Shows the account ID + the `user @ group`

- **Federated user**: a user that is defined in an external IdP (e.g., okta) and logs in into AWS with an `assumed role`
