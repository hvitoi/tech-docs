# aws-auth ConfigMap

- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/auth-configmap.html>

- This is the original authentication mode for Amazon EKS clusters.
- In this mode the cluster will source `authenticated IAM principals` from the `aws-auth` ConfigMap.
- It is mostly used for IAM roles used by `managed node groups` or `fargate profiles`
- For other use cases, consider using `access entries`

## Initial user

- The `IAM principal` (user or role) that created the cluster is the initial user that can access the cluster by using kubectl
- The initial user must add other users to the list in the `aws-auth` ConfigMap and assign permissions that affect the other users within the cluster.
- These other users can't manage or remove the initial user, as there isnâ€™t an entry in the ConfigMap to manage.

## The ConfigMap

```shell
kubectl describe cm/aws-auth -n kube-system
```

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: aws-auth
  namespace: kube-system
data:
  mapRoles: |
    # IAM roles assumed by the worker nodes
    - rolearn: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/eksctl-foo-nodegroup-bar-NodeInstanceRole-u4CxYVzWNTmG
      username: system:node:{{EC2PrivateDNSName}} # each nodes's username. E.g., system:node:ip-10-0-0-1.ec2.internal
      groups:
        - system:bootstrappers # Allows nodes to bootstrap themselves.
        - system:nodes # Grants worker nodes permissions needed to function properly.

    # IAM role assumed by CodeBuild (can be migrated into an Access Entry)
    - rolearn: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/EksCodeBuildKubectlRole
      username: build
      groups:
        - system:masters # Grants full administrative access to the Kubernetes cluster. Use this group cautiously as it provides extensive permissions.
```
