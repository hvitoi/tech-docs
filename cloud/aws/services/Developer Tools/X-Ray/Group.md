# AWS::XRay::Group

- Distributed tracing!
- X-Ray provides an `end-to-end view of requests` as they travel through your application
- Show a map of your applicationâ€™s underlying components
- You can use X-Ray to collect data `across AWS Accounts`

- Steps
  1. `Collect traces`: collect data about the request from each of the underlying application services it passes through
  1. `Record traces`: X-Ray combines the data gathered from each service into singular units called traces
  1. `View service map`: view the service map to see trace data such as latencies HTTP statuses, and metadata for each service
  1. `Analyze issues`: drill into the service showing unusual behavior to identify the root issue

## X-Ray SDK

- The application pods should `imperatively send the traces` to the single x-ray pod in each node (they won't be scraped)
- For that your application should embed the X-Ray SDK
- You can instrument each function call in the application code so that it appears as a **segment** in the trace
- You can also enable `plugins` in the X-Ray SDK. For instance the EKS plugin enhances the trace with nodes metadata (e.g., pod id, container id, etc) and the EC2 plugin (e.g., az, ami id, instance size, etc)

- Environment Variables
  - `AWS_XRAY_TRACING_NAME`: the name of the "application" that will be shown in the trace
  - `AWS_XRAY_DAEMON_ADDRESS`: where to send the traces to. E.g., "x-ray-daemonset-svc.default:2000"
  - `AWS_XRAY_CONTEXT_MISSING`: what to do when traces fails to be sent. E.g., "LOG_ERROR", "RUNTIME_ERROR"

## EKS Setup

### DaemonSet

- A `X-Ray` DaemonSet has to be deployed on the Kubernetes cluster in order to collect the traces from all the application pods in each node

- `X-Ray` pods from the DaemonSet then consolidates all the traces and send it to X-ray Service

### Permissions

- The X-Ray DaemonSet needs outbound permissions to write traces to the AWS X-Ray resource. For that an IRSA or Pod Identity is needed
- The new role needs the policy `AWSXRayDaemonWriteAccess`. This role will be associated with the ServiceAccount that will the X-Ray DaemonSet will use
