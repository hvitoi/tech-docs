# Introduction

- `AWS` was launched for public in 2004
- First services were SQS, S3 and EC2

## Regions

- A cluster of data centers in a `geographic area`
- Things to consider before choosing a region
  - `Data compliance`
  - `Proximity`: reduces latency
  - `Available services`: not all servies are available in all regions
  - `Pricing`: prices vary from region to region

## Availability Zones

- Each region has some availability zones (usually 3, min 2, max 6)
- Example: ap-southeast-2
  - ap-southeast2a
  - ap-southeast2b
  - ap-southeast2c
- The `AZ` is a (one or more) discrete data center with `redundant power`, `networking` and `connectivity`
- The AZ is designed to be independent (good for cases of failure)
- Different `AZ` within a region are connect with `high bandwidth` and `ultra-low latency network`

## Points of Presence (Edge Locations)

- It's like a region, but limited.
- It offers a way to serve content to the end user with the higher proximity possible (and lower latency)
- It's used for `caching`
