# tfstate

- `terraform.tfstate` is a `json file` that keeps track of the current infrastructure state
- The desired configuration (tf code) is then compared to the tfstate in order to know what will be changed

- `terraform.tfstate` is created locally on the first `terraform apply` command. And then modified on subsequent apply commands

## Best practices

1. Never manually modify the tfstate. Always change it through tf commands (terraform apply, terraforma state)
1. Always set up a shared remote storage to store the `.tfstate`
    - Guarantees other developers can always have the latest state and acts as a backup
    - Amazon S3, Azure Storage Account, Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud Storage, Terraform Cloud, etc
    - State storage config can be set up under `backend` block
1. Use state locking
    - Prevent concurrent runs to your state file
    - This should be configured at the storage backend
1. Enable versioning
    - Allows reversing to any previous state
    - This should be supported by the storage backend
1. Use one state file per environment
    - Dev, test, staging, prod
