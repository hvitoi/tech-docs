# Keda

- <https://github.com/kedacore/keda>
- Allows for fine-grained autoscaling for sets (deployments, replicasets, etc)
- It surges by the limitation of HPA that allows only CPU-based scaling

## Pre-emptive Scaling

- Allows `scheduled scaling`
- Usually before a major product release of event. E.g., Black Friday
