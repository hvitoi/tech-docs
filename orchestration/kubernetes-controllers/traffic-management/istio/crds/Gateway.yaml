# - A gateway is necessary to apply the traffic management rules from the proxy to a `frontend` application
# - Normally the browser access the frontend app directly via node port before the configuration in the proxy can be applied
# - `Edge proxy` is the connection with the outside world (E.g., ingress nginx)
# - In Istio, the edge proxy is the `Ingress Gateway`
