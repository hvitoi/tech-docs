# Fault injection

- Fallacies of distributed computing

  - The network is reliable
  - Latency is zero
  - Bandwidth is infinite
  - The network is secure
  - Topology doesn't change
  - There is on administrator
  - Transport cost is zero
  - The network is homogeneous

- `Fault tolerance` is important!
- `Chaos engineering` create random problems in the cluster in order to build confidence in the system
