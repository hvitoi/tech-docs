# Instrumentation

- The process of setting up an application in order to make it observable (e.g., add SDK collectors)
- An instrumented code is a code that emit traces, metrics, or logs.
- OpenTelemetry standardizes instrumentation of your applications and systems, regardless of the programming language, infrastructure, and runtime environments used.
