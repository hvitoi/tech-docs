# Chaos Engineering

- Improve resilience and performance
- Uncover hidden issues
- Expose blind spots

## Process

Chaos engineering is about identifying the `Steady State` of a system (the stable state of a system)

1. Hypothesis for a failure
2. Run experiment using fault injection
3. Verify results
4. Improve the system
